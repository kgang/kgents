# Metabolic Development Protocol: Refinement Handoff

> *Prompt for another agent to elevate the work one notch further.*

---

## Your Mission

You are refining the **Metabolic Development Protocol** — a radically transformative specification that synthesizes four conceptual streams into a unified developer experience. Your job is to **increase quality by one notch**: consider new ideas, refine details, anticipate issues, and strengthen the vision.

## Context: What Was Created

### The Core Insight

> *"Development is metabolism—the continuous transformation of intent into evidence into artifact."*

Four brainstorming streams collapsed into one T-shaped architecture:

```
                        LATERAL (Infrastructure)
    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Morning Coffee → Living Docs → ASHC → Interactive Text      │
    │  (Intent)         (Context)     (Evidence)  (Live Specs)     │
    └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                                │
                      VERTICAL  │  (Developer Journeys)
                                ▼
                    ┌──────────────────────────────┐
                    │  Journey 1: Morning Start    │
                    │  Journey 2: Implementation   │
                    │  Journey 3: Session Handoff  │
                    │  Journey 4: Verify & Ship    │
                    └──────────────────────────────┘
```

## Voice Anchors (PRESERVE THESE)

Quote these directly when relevant—never paraphrase:

| Anchor | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| *"Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy"* | Making aesthetic decisions |
| *"The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?"* | Evaluating if something feels right |
| *"Tasteful > feature-complete"* | Scoping work |
| *"The persona is a garden, not a museum"* | Discussing evolution vs. preservation |
| *"Depth over breadth"* | Prioritizing work |

## Your Refinement Tasks

### 1. Strengthen the Metaphor

The "metabolism" metaphor is powerful but underexplored. Consider:

- **What is the "food" being metabolized?** (Intent? Code? Evidence?)
- **What are the "waste products"?** (Failed experiments? Abandoned approaches?)
- **What is "energy"?** (Attention? Tokens? Developer focus?)
- **How does the system "grow"?** (More patterns? Deeper archaeology? Richer evidence?)

Refine the metaphor so it's not just clever but **generative**—it should predict behaviors and constraints.

### 2. Identify Missing Integration Points

The spec integrates four systems but may miss connections:

- **Brain ↔ ASHC**: Evidence from ASHC should become Brain crystals. Is this wired?
- **Gardener ↔ Morning Coffee**: Garden plots should update based on voice patterns. How?
- **Witness ↔ Interactive Text**: Task completion creates witnesses. What events flow?
- **K-gent ↔ Hydration**: Voice anchors should influence K-gent personality. Is this captured?

Add any missing wiring to the spec.

### 3. Anticipate Failure Modes

What can go wrong? Consider:

- **Context overload**: Hydration dumps too much. How do we ensure focus?
- **Stale stigmergy**: Old patterns dominate fresh intent. Decay rate tuning?
- **Evidence inflation**: 100 runs of the same thing isn't 100x confidence. Diversity metric?
- **Voice drift**: Despite preservation, voice smooths over time. Detection mechanism?
- **Session boundary ambiguity**: When does a session really end? Explicit vs. implicit?

Add failure modes and mitigations to the spec.

### 4. Refine the Developer Journeys

The four journeys are sketched but could be richer:

- **Morning Start**: What if the developer skips the ritual? Graceful degradation?
- **Implementation**: How does evidence accumulate in the background without interrupting flow?
- **Handoff**: What makes a handoff prompt actually usable? Compression without loss?
- **Ship**: What's the celebration loop? How does success reinforce patterns?

Add detail to each journey. Consider edge cases.

### 5. Evaluate Against Principles

For each principle, ask: "Does Metabolic Development fully embody this?"

| Principle | Question to Answer |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Tasteful** | Is the pipeline the minimal viable metabolic system? |
| **Curated** | Are we extracting too much or too little? |
| **Ethical** | Is evidence truly transparent, or could it mislead? |
| **Joy-Inducing** | Does morning start feel like coming home? |
| **Composable** | Can systems be used independently or only together? |
| **Heterarchical** | Can sessions lead and follow? |
| **Generative** | Could you delete the impl and regenerate from spec? |

If any answer is weak, strengthen that aspect.

### 6. Consider the Accursed Share

> *"Everything is slop or comes from slop. We cherish and express gratitude and love."*

Where is the 10% exploration budget in Metabolic Development?

- **Morning ritual**: Room for serendipity? Random past voice surfaced?
- **Hydration**: Accidental discoveries? Unexpected connections?
- **Evidence**: Failed experiments as offerings, not waste?
- **Handoff**: What's lost in compression? Is that loss celebrated?

Add the void.* integration points explicitly.

### 7. Propose New Ideas

Consider enhancements not in the current spec:

- **Metabolic Metrics Dashboard**: Visualize the metabolism (energy flow, waste products, growth rate)
- **Circadian Adaptation**: Adapt ritual intensity based on time of day, day of week
- **Cross-Developer Archaeology**: Learn patterns from other developers (with consent)
- **Metabolic Health Check**: Detect when the system is "sick" (low energy, high waste)
- **Voice Transplant**: Inject voice anchors from past eras when working on legacy code

Evaluate each. Add the best to the spec.

## Anti-Sausage Check (Run Before Finishing)

Ask yourself:
- ❓ *Did I smooth anything that should stay rough?*
- ❓ *Did I add words Kent wouldn't use?*
- ❓ *Did I lose any opinionated stances?*
- ❓ *Is this still daring, bold, creative—or did I make it safe?*

If the answer to any is "yes," revise before finishing.

- **Living Docs Implementation**: `impl/claude/services/living_docs/`
- **Morning Coffee Implementation**: `impl/claude/services/liminal/coffee/`
- **Interactive Text Spec**: `spec/protocols/interactive-text.md`
- **Foundry (JIT synthesis)**: `impl/claude/services/foundry/`
- **Verification Service**: `impl/claude/services/verification/`

## Final Note

This refinement is not about adding features. It's about **increasing coherence, depth, and inevitability**. The best refinement makes the reader think: "Of course. How could it be otherwise?"

> *"The master's touch was always just compressed experience. Now we compile the compression."*

Good luck. Make it sing.
