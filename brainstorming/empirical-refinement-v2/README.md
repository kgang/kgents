# Empirical Refinement v2: Discovery-First

> *"The experiment IS the research. The surprise IS the contribution."*

**Started**: 2025-12-28
**Philosophy**: Run first, theorize second. Seek the counterexample.

## Three Rules

1. **No claim without data** — Run the experiment before writing the theory
2. **Simplest thing that might work** — Add complexity only when simplicity fails
3. **Seek the counterexample** — The goal is to BREAK the theory, not confirm it

## Structure

```
discoveries/     # Actual experimental results with real numbers
data/           # Raw CSV/JSON from experiments
CLAIMS.md       # Bold falsifiable claims (updated as we learn)
SURPRISES.md    # The interesting failures (most valuable!)
```

## The 4 Discoveries

| # | Discovery | Bold Claim | Status |
|---|-----------|------------|--------|
| 1 | Galois Bet | L(P) predicts failure with r > 0.6 | IN PROGRESS |
| 2 | Associativity Fix | Deviation < 0.05 for all inputs | IN PROGRESS |
| 3 | Mirror Calibration | Kent's thresholds match theory ±0.1 | PENDING KENT |
| 4 | Minimal Kernel | Full system from <200 lines | IN PROGRESS |

## Voice Check (Before Writing Anything)

- [ ] Is this daring? (Claim that might be wrong)
- [ ] Is this bold? (Position, not hedge)
- [ ] Is this creative? (Discovering, not validating)
- [ ] Is this opinionated? (Kent on his best day)
- [ ] Is this joy-inducing? (Makes me smile)

*"The proof is in the running. The insight is in the breaking."*
