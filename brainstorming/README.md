### The Philosophical Foundation (Read These First)

**1. Agent-as-Witness** — *"An agent is a thing that justifies its behavior."*

Synthesizes three explorations into unified theory:
- Decision Quality Proofs (Toulmin argumentation, defeasibility)
- Decision Trace Schema (Mark → Walk → Playbook primitives)
- Witness Open Questions (Kent's calibration interview)

**2. Symmetric Supersession** — *"The system should supersede Kent because he allows it to."*

Extends Agent-as-Witness with radical evolution:
- Kent modeled as symmetric agent (same as AI)
- Nominatively adversarial for cooperative fusion
- System can supersede Kent when: valid proofs + sound arguments + sufficient evidence + no disgust
- The disgust veto as ethical floor

Together these form the philosophical core of kgents.
