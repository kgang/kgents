### The Philosophical Foundation (Read These First)

**1. Agent-as-Witness** — *"An agent is a thing that justifies its behavior."*

Synthesizes three explorations into unified theory:
- Decision Quality Proofs (Toulmin argumentation, defeasibility)
- Decision Trace Schema (Mark → Walk → Playbook primitives)
- Witness Open Questions (Kent's calibration interview)

**2. Symmetric Supersession** — *"The system should supersede Kent because he allows it to."*

Extends Agent-as-Witness with radical evolution:
- Kent modeled as symmetric agent (same as AI)
- Nominatively adversarial for cooperative fusion
- System can supersede Kent when: valid proofs + sound arguments + sufficient evidence + no disgust
- The disgust veto as ethical floor

Together these form the philosophical core of kgents.

### Spec (Compressed)

The brainstorming has been distilled into:

**`spec/protocols/witness-supersession.md`** — 322 lines from 1177 lines (3.6x compression)

## Implementation Status

| Phase | Delivers | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Phase 0** | Mark, MarkStore, `time.witness.mark`, `self.witness` | ✅ Complete |
| Phase 1 | Walk (session streams), explicit Toulmin | Planned |
| Phase 2 | Stigmergic memory, pattern extraction | Planned |
| Phase 3 | ASHC integration, causal learning | Planned |
| Phase 4 | Dialectical engine, `self.fusion.*` | Planned |
| Phase 5 | Back-solved coherence, value drift detection | Planned |

**Phase 0 was already implemented** when the PLANs were written. 47 tests pass.
