# Ontological and Epistemological Crosswalk

This maps the requested hierarchy to existing hierarchies in the spec. It is a scaffolding for the Zero Seed graph.

---

## 1) Requested hierarchy to kgents layers

Requested term -> kgents layer

- Assumptions / axioms -> Foundational constraints (category laws, operad laws)
- Beliefs -> K-gent persona beliefs (k-gent/persona.md)
- Lifestyle / entitlements -> Governance and constitutional articles (CONSTITUTION, Emerging Articles)
- Values / principles / affinities -> Seven Principles + value traits in config system
- Dreams / goals / plans / gestures / attention -> Intent and plan stack (plans/, CLI v7 planning)
- Specification / proofs / evidence / argumentations / policy -> Spec system + ASHC proofs + evidence model
- Execution / implementation / results / experimental data -> impl/ + protocols/metabolic-development.md
- Reflection / synthesis / delta on process / process reward mechanisms -> metabolic-development + living-docs + witness assurance loops
- Representation / interpretation / analysis / insights / meta-reflection / meta-cognition / ethics -> AGENTESE projections and observer dependence (principles/meta.md)

---

## 2) Crosswalk to AGENTESE contexts

- self: beliefs, lifestyle, attention, entitlements
- concept: axioms, principles, specifications, proofs
- time: results, experimental data, trajectories, reflections
- world: execution, implementation, policies, evidence

---

## 3) Crosswalk to polynomial structure

- positions: stance or layer (assumption, value, plan, spec, execution, reflection, representation)
- directions: allowed morphisms between layers
- transitions: validated transformations (proof-backed) between layers

---

## 4) Evidence hierarchy (witness assurance)

- L-∞ Orphan: ungrounded assumption or dream
- L0 Mark: gesture or attention captured as witness
- L1 Trace: execution trace linked to plan
- L2 Test: evidence for implementation and result
- L3 Proof: formal proof for policy or argumentation

---

## 5) Living documents

- Specifications and policies are living docs
- Evidence and proofs are living docs
- Reflections and syntheses are living docs

---

## 6) Where to attach livelihood intelligence

- Evidence -> Livelihood scores
- Results -> Trajectory updates
- Reflection -> Causality disputes
