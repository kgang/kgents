## Sound Design

### Buzzing Variations
**33. Hornet Drone** - Deep 85Hz with harsh harmonics. Larger, meaner.
**34. Worker Bee Hum** - Light 220Hz, slightly pleasant. Menacing only in numbers.
**35. Guard Bee Growl** - Lower 150Hz with rhythmic pulsing. Audible threat.
**36. Queen Resonance** - Complex chord, almost musical. Unmistakably royal.
**37. Swarm Crescendo** - Individual buzzes blur into white-noise wall.

### Combat Sounds
**38. Stinger Pierce** - Sharp "thwick" like needle through leather + high ring.
**39. Mandible Crunch** - Wet chitinous crack. Pistachio shell underwater.
**40. Wing Clip Hit** - Papery tear + asymmetric buzz.
**41. Honey Squelch** - Thick viscous sound. Slow and sticky.
**42. Bee Pop** - Slightly comical "bwip" on defeat. Satisfying, not gross.

### Alert Frequencies
**43. Alarm Pheromone** - Rising sine wave 400Hz→2kHz over 0.3s. Biologically accurate.
**44. Hive Heartbeat** - Deep 20-30Hz subsonic pulse. Feel more than hear.
**45. Queen Call** - Descending three-note pattern, almost vocal.
**46. Danger Proximity Tone** - High whine increasing as threats approach off-screen.

## Music & Atmosphere

### Intensity Layers
**47. Layer 1 Calm** - Soft ambient hum, distant wings, occasional drip.
**48. Layer 2 Alert** - Wood block percussion at 90bpm, tense strings.
**49. Layer 3 Combat** - Full drums, aggressive minor brass, 120bpm.
**50. Layer 4 Siege** - Distorted bass, chaotic polyrhythms, dissonant brass.
**51. Layer 5 Boss** - Everything drops to ominous drone, builds operatic.

### Moment Punctuation
**52. The Silence Before** - 2s complete audio void before major events. Deafening.
**53. Victory Fanfare** - Major brass resolution + ascending wing flutter.
**54. Death Sting** - Single low piano note with long reverb. Mournful.
**55. Wave Complete** - Crystalline bell (honey cell resonating). Closure.

## UI Aesthetics

### Hexagonal Language
**56. Health Bar** - Six connected hexagons cracking/darkening. Honey draining.
**57. XP Counter** - Honeycomb cells filling with amber fluid simulation.
**58. Cooldown Indicators** - Hexagonal spiral fill like honey deposit.
**59. Menu Buttons** - Hex tiles with beeswax texture, 3D depth, glow hover.
**60. Minimap** - Honeycomb grid overlay, enemies as dots in cells.

### Textures
**61. Wax Paper Background** - Translucent beeswax with visible cell structure.
**62. Propolis Borders** - Dark, organic, glossy/wet appearance.
**63. Honey Highlights** - Interactive elements with amber backlight glow.

**70. Wall Formation** - Horizontal line advancing with sine wave oscillation.
**71. Sphere Defense** - Orbiting layers rotating opposite directions.
**72. Arrow Strike** - V-formation accelerating, breaking on contact.

### Attack Tells
**73. Charging Glow** - Intensifying golden aura for 0.5s. Learnable.

## Environmental Visuals

### Hive Interior
**77. Comb Corridors** - Narrow passages between hanging comb. Tactical positioning.
**78. Honey Chamber** - Floor flooded in translucent honey. Visible movement penalty.
**79. Brood Nursery** - Capped cells with visible larva silhouettes. Disturbing if attacked.
**80. Queen Chamber** - Massive room with bioluminescent cells, lit from below.

### External
**81. Flower Field** - Oversized stems as cover, petals releasing pollen.
**82. Tree Cavity** - Bark texture walls, natural light shafts.
**83. Rain Sequence** - Player-sized droplets as deadly hazards.
**84. Night Garden** - Bioluminescent only, enemies visible by own glow/sound.

### Dynamic Elements
**85. Collapsing Comb** - Damaged structures fall, new paths, crushing.
**86. Honey Flow** - Real-time liquid trapping/slowing both sides.
**87. Smoke Intrusion** - Beekeeper smoke disorients all characters.
**88. Seasonal Shift** - Background transitions summer→autumn over game.

## Polish

### Micro-Interactions
**89. Idle Animation** - Hornet cleans antenna after 3s stationary.
**90. Movement Particles** - Wing-generated wind disturbs pollen.
**91. Landing Impact** - Dust cloud proportional to speed.
**92. Collection Magnetism** - Resources curve toward player. Satisfying pull.

### Weather/Time
**93. Golden Hour** - Warm amber during easier waves, cooler for difficulty.
**94. Dusk Transition** - Gradual darkening, firefly-like bee eyes as light.
**95. Morning Dew** - Reflective droplets refracting rainbow highlights.

### Impact
**96. Proportional Shake** - Larger enemies = larger shake. Boss kills seismic.
**97. Directional Push** - Camera moves opposite to attack directions.
**98. Freeze Frame** - 2-frame pause on significant kills.
