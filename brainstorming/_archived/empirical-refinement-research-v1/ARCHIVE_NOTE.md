# Archive Note: empirical-refinement-research-v1

**Date archived**: 2025-12-28

**Reason**: Literature review masquerading as research. 22 laws claimed, 5 verified. Zero experiments run. Starting over with discovery-first approach.

## What Was Learned

- **Associativity law FAILS for averaging composition** - This is actually a significant finding that needs proper experimental validation
- **Compression ratio 0.084 = good generative structure** - Promising metric for spec quality
- **350-line minimal kernel identified** - The categorical core can be expressed compactly
- **Pilot integration hooks are valuable** - Keep these patterns for v2

---

## What to Preserve for v2

1. **The 34 references in bibliography** (`08-bibliography.md`)
   - Well-curated academic sources on category theory, operads, sheaves
   - Should inform experiment design, not replace it

2. **The 5 experiment designs** (`07-experiments-protocol.md`)
   - But actually RUN them this time
   - Convert from "claimed" to "verified"

3. **The pilot integration map concept** (`03-experience-quality-operad.md`)
   - The idea of mapping pilots to categorical structures is sound
   - Needs grounding in actual pilot behavior, not theoretical ideals

*This archive represents aspirational theory without empirical grounding. v2 should start with experiments and let theory emerge from evidence.*
