## Learnings

```
2025-12-13  Three Phases (SENSE→ACT→REFLECT) compress 11 without loss
2025-12-13  Turn is fundamental: single trace derives all panels (holographic)
2025-12-13  Posture is polynomial: (phase, activity) → symbol
2025-12-13  Weather metaphors: entropy=clouds, queue=pressure, tokens=temperature
2025-12-13  Two-tier collection: try context, fallback direct; graceful degradation
2025-12-13  Operads define grammar; algebras apply grammar to systems
2025-12-13  Sheaf gluing = emergence: compatible locals → global
2025-12-13  LLM-once cheap: pre-compute, hotload forever (AD-004)
2025-12-12  Skills pull before doing, push after learning
2025-12-12  Purgatory > Generator: eject state as data, not pause frames
2025-12-12  Flux > Loop: streams are event-driven, not timer-driven
2025-12-12  Perturbation principle: invoke() on running flux injects, never bypasses
2025-12-12  Store Comonad > State Monad for context
2025-12-12  Projector ≠ lens: compression violates Get-Put
2025-12-12  K-gent = Governance Functor, not chatbot
2025-12-12  Symmetric lifting: every functor needs lift() AND unlift()
2025-12-12  Stigmergic surface: agents append, humans curate
2025-12-12  PolyAgent[S,A,B] > Agent[A,B]: mode-dependent behavior
2025-12-11  T/U split: testing vs tools is categorical
2025-12-11  OCap for trust: BypassToken is unforgeable
2025-12-13  Wiring is composition: factory→factory→node forms morphism chain
2025-12-13  Mock+Real test pairs: isolation tests + integration verification
2025-12-13  Graceful degradation: return informative errors, don't crash
2025-12-14  Streaming ≠ mutability: ephemeral chunks project immutable Turns
2025-12-14  Forest handles: plans ARE handles; epilogues ARE witnesses; dormant = accursed share
```

## Anti-Patterns

```
2025-12-13  Terminology sprawl: one metaphor system, not five competing
2025-12-12  Generator Trap: pickle can't serialize stack frames
2025-12-12  Timer-driven loops create zombies
2025-12-12  Bypassing running loops causes state schizophrenia
2025-12-12  Context dumping: large payloads tax every turn
2025-12-12  Keyword intercept dangerous: "delete"→"Minimalism"→auto-approve
2025-12-11  Full ouroboros (feedback=1.0) → solipsism
```

## Unanswered

```
2025-12-12  DensityField animation: 30fps always or only when focused?
2025-12-12  Flux → archetype wiring (Consolidator, Spawner)?
2025-12-12  ModalScope: duplicate() → git stash/branch mapping?
```
