**Quick Start**: Read `HYDRATE.md` (root) → `_forest.md` (canopy) → `_focus.md` (human intent)

## Key Files

| File | Purpose | Agent Protocol |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `/HYDRATE.md` | The seed — ground yourself here | Read first |
| `_forest.md` | Canopy — visible state | Regenerate |
| `_focus.md` | Human intent | **Never overwrite** |
| `meta.md` | Mycelium — learnings | Append, 50-line cap |
| `principles.md` | Forest Protocol | Read for coordination |
| `skills/` | HOW-TO guides | Pull → Apply → Push |
| `_epilogues/` | Session handoffs | Write at session end |

---

## Session Workflow

```bash
cat HYDRATE.md             # Ground
cat plans/_forest.md       # Canopy
cat plans/_focus.md        # Human intent
ls plans/_epilogues/       # Previous session
```
