# The Six Jewel Crown

> *"28 ideas → 6 reference applications. The Crown is our compass."*

The **Six Jewel Crown** is kgents' set of reference software applications. Progress on these apps—and the elegance of their execution—defines our project-level KPIs. Every sprint, every arc, every odyssey is measured against how these jewels shine.

## The Crown

| Jewel | Frame | Revenue | Status | Meta-Framework Push |
|-------|-------|---------|--------|---------------------|
| **[Atelier](./atelier-experience.md)** | Creative workshop + spectators | Token economy | 90% | Flux streaming, observer-dependent UX |
| **[Coalition Forge](./coalition-forge.md)** | Multi-agent task completion | Per-task credits | 85% | Operad-driven composition, visible dynamics |
| **[Holographic Brain](./holographic-brain.md)** | PKM as living topology | $9/$29/$99 | 95% | Sheaf coherence, stigmergic evolution |
| **[Punchdrunk Park](./punchdrunk-park.md)** | Narrative + agent consent | Experience tickets | 80% | Consent debt polynomial, INHABIT mode |
| **[Domain Simulation](./domain-simulation.md)** | Enterprise B2B simulations | $50-150k/yr | 75% | Domain polynomials, enterprise sheaves |
| **[Gestalt](./gestalt-architecture-visualizer.md)** | Living architecture ops | $29-199/seat | 5% | Reactive projections, cartography primitives |

## Why "Six Jewel Crown"?

Each jewel is a **lens** through which our meta-frameworks are tested, refined, and proven:

1. **Atelier** stresses **Flux** (streaming-first architecture)
2. **Coalition Forge** stresses **Operads** (composition grammar at runtime)
3. **Holographic Brain** stresses **Sheaves** (local→global coherence)
4. **Punchdrunk Park** stresses **Polynomials** (consent as continuous state)
5. **Domain Simulation** stresses **Tenancy + Terrarium** (enterprise requirements)
6. **Gestalt** stresses **Reactive Substrate** (multi-target projection)

If any framework cannot elegantly serve all six jewels, the framework is incomplete.

## Master Plan

See `plans/core-apps-synthesis.md` for:
- Full synthesis analysis (28 ideas → 6 apps)
- Pattern recognition and overlap reconciliation
- Unified architecture diagram
- Implementation roadmap
- Open questions and research backlog

---

## Shared Foundation

All six apps instantiate the same categorical pattern (AD-006):

```
 PolyAgent[S, A, B]  ──  Operad (grammar)  ──  Sheaf (emergence)
```

The Crown is proof that one mathematical foundation can generate infinite experiences.

## The Crown as KPI

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Crown Completion** | Average % across all 6 apps | 80% by Q2 2025 |
| **Crown Elegance** | Lines of app-specific code / total lines | <30% |
| **Crown Cross-Pollination** | Features that benefit 3+ apps | >50% |
| **Crown Joy** | Subjective "would I use this?" score | 4.5/5 |

---

## Priority Order (Arc 1: Foundation)

1. **Atelier** — Lowest lift, highest demo value, proves streaming
2. **Coalition Forge** — Proves visible agent dynamics at scale
3. **Holographic Brain** — M-gent UI, proves memory topology
4. **Gestalt** — Developer tool, proves reactive multi-target
5. **Punchdrunk Park** — The grand vision, proves consent mechanics
6. **Domain Simulation** — Enterprise revenue, proves tenancy
