# The Seven Jewel Crown

> *"28 ideas → 7 reference applications. The Crown is our compass."*

The **Seven Jewel Crown** is kgents' set of reference software applications. Progress on these apps—and the elegance of their execution—defines our project-level KPIs. Every sprint, every arc, every odyssey is measured against how these jewels shine.

**See also**: `plans/crown-jewels-enlightened.md` for the unified strategy.

## The Crown (Status as of 2025-12-16)

| Jewel | Frame | Revenue | Progress | Meta-Framework Push | Tests |
|-------|-------|---------|----------|---------------------|-------|
| **[Holographic Brain](./holographic-brain.md)** | PKM as living topology | $9/$29/$99 | **100%** ✅ | Sheaf coherence, stigmergic evolution | 212+ |
| **[Gardener](./the-gardener.md)** | Autopoietic dev interface | — | **100%** ✅ | N-Phase, Tending Calculus, Auto-Inducer | 163+ |
| **[Gestalt](./gestalt-architecture-visualizer.md)** | Living architecture ops | $29-199/seat | **70%** | Reactive projections, cartography primitives | 92+ |
| **[Atelier](./atelier-experience.md)** | Creative workshop + spectators | Token economy | **65%** | Flux streaming, observer-dependent UX | — |
| **[Coalition Forge](./coalition-forge.md)** | Multi-agent task completion | Per-task credits | **55%** | Operad-driven composition, visible dynamics | — |
| **[Punchdrunk Park](./punchdrunk-park.md)** | Narrative + agent consent | Experience tickets | **40%** | Consent debt polynomial, INHABIT mode | 64+ |
| **[Domain Simulation](./domain-simulation.md)** | Enterprise B2B simulations | $50-150k/yr | **0%** | Domain polynomials, enterprise sheaves | — |

**Hero Path (Tier 1)**: Brain + Gestalt + Gardener = **90%** average

## Why "Seven Jewel Crown"?

Each jewel is a **lens** through which our meta-frameworks are tested, refined, and proven:

1. **Brain** stresses **Sheaves** (local→global coherence, holographic memory)
2. **Gardener** stresses **N-Phase + AGENTESE** (autopoietic development)
3. **Gestalt** stresses **Reactive Substrate** (multi-target projection)
4. **Atelier** stresses **Flux** (streaming-first architecture)
5. **Coalition Forge** stresses **Operads** (composition grammar at runtime)
6. **Punchdrunk Park** stresses **Polynomials** (consent as continuous state)
7. **Domain Simulation** stresses **Tenancy + Terrarium** (enterprise requirements)

If any framework cannot elegantly serve all seven jewels, the framework is incomplete.

## Master Plan

See `plans/core-apps-synthesis.md` for:
- Full synthesis analysis (28 ideas → 6 apps)
- Pattern recognition and overlap reconciliation
- Unified architecture diagram
- Implementation roadmap
- Open questions and research backlog

---

## Shared Foundation

All six apps instantiate the same categorical pattern (AD-006):

```
 PolyAgent[S, A, B]  ──  Operad (grammar)  ──  Sheaf (emergence)
```

The Crown is proof that one mathematical foundation can generate infinite experiences.

## The Crown as KPI

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Crown Completion** | Average % across all 6 apps | 80% by Q2 2025 |
| **Crown Elegance** | Lines of app-specific code / total lines | <30% |
| **Crown Cross-Pollination** | Features that benefit 3+ apps | >50% |
| **Crown Joy** | Subjective "would I use this?" score | 4.5/5 |

## Priority Order (Hero Path Strategy)

**Tier 1 (Hero Path)** — The "wow moment" experience:
1. **Holographic Brain** ✅ — COMPLETE. Production-ready PKM
2. **Gardener** ✅ — COMPLETE. Autopoietic development interface
3. **Gestalt** — 70% complete. Living architecture visualization

**Tier 2 (Extensions)** — Built on Tier 1 foundation:
4. **Atelier** — 65% complete. Creative workshop
5. **Coalition Forge** — 55% complete. Multi-agent task completion

**Tier 3 (Full Crown)** — Completing the 7:
6. **Punchdrunk Park** — 40% complete. Narrative + consent
7. **Domain Simulation** — 0% stub. Enterprise B2B
