## Quick Summary

### Genesis (First Run)
- No empty states—Constitutional Graph pre-seeded
- User explores 22 K-Blocks across 4 layers
- First action: extend the Constitution with personal axiom

### Ingest (Documents → K-Blocks)
- Upload any document
- System proposes K-Block decomposition
- Axioms, principles, gotchas detected
- Derivation edges to Constitution

### Workspace (K-Block Editing)
- vim-like modal navigation
- Hyperdimensional views (Prose/Graph/Code/Diff)
- Monadic isolation with explicit commit
- Garden lifecycle for K-Blocks

### Dogfooding (kgents in kgents)
- All specs ingested as K-Blocks
- All implementations linked
- All decisions witnessed
- Full traceability from axiom to code

## Next Actions

1. [ ] Implement `GenesisPage` component
2. [ ] Seed Constitutional Graph in backend
3. [ ] Build `IngestPage` with K-Block proposal UI
4. [ ] Wire up workspace with modes and harness
5. [ ] Create `kg dogfood` command group
6. [ ] Ingest all existing specs
