## Five Evolution/Economics Jokes

1. **"Why did the phage go bankrupt?"**
   Because it hardcoded the test outputs and the Demon detected the parasitic pattern. Stake forfeited!

2. **"What's the difference between a mutation and a miracle?"**
   A mutation has a negative Gibbs Free Energy. A miracle has ΔG > 0 and somehow still passes the Demon.

3. **"How many tokens does it cost to predict the future?"**
   None! The Prediction Market does it for free—Layer 5 is FREE. You only pay when you bet (and lose).

4. **"Why don't hypotheses use natural language?"**
   Because B-gent charges a 20% pidgin tax. Smart hypotheses speak Citation DSL: `ref(Smith20,transformers)` (3 tokens vs 14).

5. **"What did the Sun say to the conservative mutator?"**
   "Here's 10,000 tokens. Go break something interesting. Heat death is for cowards."

## Cross-Pollination Opportunities

### 1. **Hypothesis → Intent Pipeline**
- HypothesisEngine generates hypothesis
- Embed hypothesis into Intent vector
- Feed to TeleologicalDemon Layer 3
- **Result**: Evolution aligned to scientific theories

### 2. **Budget-Aware Evolution**
- RoCMonitor tracks mutation costs
- Only evolve modules with RoC < 1.0 (need improvement)
- **Result**: Evolution focuses on "money pits"

### 3. **VoI for Phage Monitoring**
- AdaptiveObserver decides which phages to watch
- High-risk phages get telemetry, low-risk get spot checks
- **Result**: Observation budget optimally allocated

### 4. **Compression Economics for Schemas**
- Track schema-to-schema communication
- Synthesize "Schema Pidgin" for common patterns
- **Result**: Mutation vectors compressed 80%

### 5. **Robin as Evolution Oracle**
- Robin generates hypothesis: "This module is too complex"
- E-gent generates mutations to test hypothesis
- Robin validates: "Complexity reduced 40%"
- **Result**: Scientific method meets code evolution

### 6. **Fiscal Constitution Guards**
- Grammar ensures mutations can't exceed token budget
- Constitutional Banker pre-checks stake availability
- **Result**: No mid-infection bankruptcies

### 7. **JIT-Optimized Demon**
- Compile Layer 1-4 filters to bytecode (J-gent)
- 10x speedup on mutation filtering
- **Result**: Process 1000 mutations/second

### 8. **Market-Driven Temperature**
- Low market odds → increase temperature (more exploration)
- High market odds → decrease temperature (more exploitation)
- **Result**: Self-regulating evolution

## Key Insight

**The most powerful idea from B-gents + E-gents is the marriage of thermodynamics and economics:**

Evolution without economics → random walk (inefficient)
Evolution without thermodynamics → hill climbing (local optima)
Evolution without teleology → parasitic drift (gaming tests)

**B×E Integration creates:**
- **Thermodynamic constraints** (ΔG < 0) → viability filter
- **Economic constraints** (market odds, stakes) → value filter
- **Teleological constraints** (Intent alignment) → purpose filter

This triple constraint ensures evolution is:
1. **Viable** (thermodynamically favorable)
2. **Valuable** (economically justified)
3. **Purposeful** (aligned with user intent)

**The ultimate demo would be:**
A live TUI showing a codebase evolving in real-time, with:
- Hypothesis engine generating theories about code quality
- Mutator proposing schema-based changes
- Demon filtering through 5 layers (rejection stats visible)
- Market showing odds for each mutation
- Phages infecting code (with stakes at risk)
- Budget dashboard showing token flow
- RoC tracking showing which mutations were profitable

All orchestrated by Sun grants from the user's explicit intent.
