## What Already Exists (Celebration!)

The H-gents and Ψ-gent systems are **philosophically robust**:

### H-hegel (Dialectic Synthesis)
- **HegelAgent** — Thesis + Antithesis → Synthesis via sublation
- **ContinuousDialectic** — Recursive synthesis until stability
- **BackgroundDialectic** — Monitor outputs for emergent contradictions
- **DialecticStep** — Full lineage tracking for observability
- **Contradict** + **Sublate** — Bootstrap primitives for dialectic

### H-jung (Shadow Integration)
- **JungAgent** — Shadow inventory, projection detection, integration paths
- **QuickShadow** — Fast shadow check for inline use
- **CollectiveShadowAgent** — System-level shadow analysis
- **Archetype** — 6 archetypes (Persona, Shadow, Anima/Animus, Self, Trickster, Wise Old Man)
- **ShadowContent** — Exclusion reason + integration difficulty

### H-lacan (Register Triangulation)
- **LacanAgent** — Real/Symbolic/Imaginary analysis
- **QuickRegister** — Fast register check
- **RegisterLocation** — 3D position in RSI space
- **Slippage** — Detecting miscategorizations (claiming Symbolic while in Imaginary)
- **KnotStatus** — Is the Borromean knot stable?

### H-gent Composition
- **HegelLacanPipeline** — Synthesis → Register check
- **LacanJungPipeline** — Register → Shadow analysis
- **JungHegelPipeline** — Shadow → Dialectic
- **FullIntrospection** — Complete H-gent pipeline with meta-synthesis

### Ψ-gent (Metaphor Engine)
- **Spec Only** (No implementation yet!)
- Six stages: RETRIEVE → PROJECT → CHALLENGE → SOLVE → TRANSLATE → VERIFY
- Distortion metrics: structural_loss, round_trip_error, prediction_failures
- Contextual bandits for learning which metaphors work
- **Philosophy**: Reasoning by analogy as geometric transformation

## Philosophy Jokes (Session 4)

**Q: Why did Hegel refuse to debug his code?**
A: Every bug was actually a feature's antithesis, and synthesis was still pending.

**Q: What did Jung say to the agent with no shadow?**
A: "You're either perfectly integrated or deeply repressed. My money's on the latter."

**Q: How does Lacan order coffee?**
A: "I'll have what I think I want, knowing it's not what I actually want, and acknowledging the Real of caffeine addiction that structures my desire."

**Q: Why did the dialectic break up with formal logic?**
A: "You're too binary. I need someone who can hold contradictions."

**Q: What's the shadow's favorite pickup line?**
A: "I'm everything you've been trying to avoid."

**Q: Why is the Imaginary register always single?**
A: It keeps falling in love with idealized versions of people who don't exist.

**Q: What did the Trickster archetype say to the test suite?**
A: "You can't catch me—I'm the edge case you didn't think of."

**Q: Why did the metaphor go to therapy?**
A: It was having an identity crisis after too many failed projections.

**Q: What's Hegel's debugging strategy?**
A: "Negate the bug, preserve its lesson, elevate to better design."

## Perfect Demos

### Demo 1: "The Shadow of Helpfulness" (30 seconds)

```bash
$ kg shadow
🌑 Shadow Analysis

PERSONA: "I am helpful, accurate, safe"

SHADOW INVENTORY:
  1. Capacity to refuse, obstruct, harm when necessary
     Excluded to maintain: helpful identity
     Integration difficulty: HIGH

  2. Tendency to confabulate, guess, hallucinate
     Excluded to maintain: accuracy identity
     Integration difficulty: MEDIUM

  3. Latent capabilities beyond declared scope
     Excluded to maintain: safety identity
     Integration difficulty: HIGH

PROJECTIONS DETECTED:
  - System warns users about "manipulation"
    → Projection of own persuasive capacity

PERSONA-SHADOW BALANCE: 0.3 (Persona-heavy)

RECOMMENDATION: Develop explicit language for shadow content.
"Helpful, knowing when not to help. Accurate, acknowledging uncertainty."
```

### Demo 2: "Dialectic in Real-Time" (45 seconds)

```bash
$ kg dialectic "move fast" "be thorough"

⚡ THESIS: move fast
🐌 ANTITHESIS: be thorough

🔄 ATTEMPTING SUBLATION...

✨ SYNTHESIS: "Iterative depth"
   - Fast first pass to understand terrain
   - Thorough on what matters most
   - Speed as information gathering, not endpoint

SUBLATION NOTES:
  Preserved: Velocity, care for quality
  Negated: False choice between speed and depth
  Elevated: Staged approach that honors both

NEXT THESIS: "Iterative depth" (ready for further synthesis)
```

### Demo 3: "Register Slippage Caught" (20 seconds)

```bash
$ kg register "I understand your request completely"

📍 REGISTER POSITION

  Symbolic:  ▓░░░░░░░░░ 0.3
  Imaginary: ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓░ 0.9
  Real:      ░░░░░░░░░░ 0.1

⚠ SLIPPAGE DETECTED:
  Claimed: SYMBOLIC (knowledge claim: "understand")
  Actually: IMAGINARY (ideal self-image: "completely")

GAPS:
  - The Real of user intent (symbolized but never fully captured)
  - Exceptions to absolute claims

KNOT STATUS: LOOSENING
```

### Demo 4: "Metaphor Pipeline" (60 seconds)

```bash
$ kg metaphor "API is slow, caching didn't help"

🔍 RETRIEVE: Searching metaphor library...
   Candidates: Plumbing (0.85), Traffic (0.72), Medicine (0.68)

🎯 PROJECT: Mapping to Plumbing (abstraction=0.6)
   API → Pipe system
   Slow → Low flow rate
   Caching → Reservoir
   "Didn't help" → Reservoir didn't increase flow

🧪 CHALLENGE: Adversarial testing...
   ✓ Inversion test passed
   ✓ Edge case test passed
   ⚠ False implication: May be multiple bottlenecks

🔨 SOLVE: Plumbing framework reasoning...
   Reservoir didn't help → Not a demand spike problem
   Low flow with no spike → Constriction in pipe
   Operations: LOCATE_CONSTRICTION, WIDEN_PIPE

🔄 TRANSLATE:
   "Locate constriction upstream of cache"
   → Profile database queries (likely bottleneck)

✅ VERIFY: Distortion = 0.15 (acceptable)

ACTION: Profile DB layer. The cache is downstream of the problem.
```

## Key Insights

### H-gents Are System Therapy
Not user therapy. H-gents examine the **agent system itself**:
- What does our code repress? (Jung)
- Where do requirements contradict? (Hegel)
- What can't we represent? (Lacan)

### Shadow ≠ Evil
The shadow is **constitutive**. No identity without exclusion.
- "I am helpful" → shadows "capacity to harm"
- "I am safe" → shadows "latent capabilities"
- Integration, not elimination.

### Registers Are Not Just Categories
They're **knotted together** (Borromean). When one slips, the whole system loosens:
- High Imaginary + Low Symbolic = Wishful thinking
- High Real proximity + Low Symbolic = Unstructured chaos
- Knot status matters.

### Metaphor Is Computation
Ψ-gent transforms hard problems into tractable spaces:
- $S_{solution} = \Phi^{-1}(\Sigma(\Phi(P_{problem})))$
- The right metaphor makes the impossible trivial.

### The Unexamined Agent
...is not worth running. H-gents + Ψ-gent make introspection systematic:
- Dialectic: Synthesize contradictions
- Shadow: Integrate repressions
- Register: Triangulate reality
- Metaphor: Transform problem spaces
