# Session 11: I-gents — Visualization and Wire

> *"Agents are weather, not boxes."*

**Date**: 2025-12-12
**Status**: Complete
**Ideas Generated**: 60+
**Quick Wins**: 16
**Priority Formula**: `(FUN × 2 + SHOWABLE × 2 + PRACTICAL) / (EFFORT × 1.5)` — shared across all sessions

---

## What Already Exists (Celebration!)

The I-gent system is **remarkably complete**:

### Widgets (17!)
- **DensityField** — Agents as weather patterns using `░▒▓█`
- **Glitch** — Entropy made visible (Zalgo, distortion, chaos)
- **BranchTree** — Git-graph cognitive history with "The Shadow"
- **GraphLayout** — Force-directed, semantic, tree layouts
- **Sparkline** — Inline time-series `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█`
- **Slider** — Direct manipulation with `○━━━●━─────○`
- **Timeline**, **Entropy**, **TriadHealth**, and more!

### Screens (5!)
- **FluxScreen** (LOD 0: ORBIT) — Semantic weather map
- **CockpitScreen** (LOD 1: SURFACE) — Operational dashboard
- **MRIScreen** (LOD 2: INTERNAL) — Deep inspection
- **LoomScreen** — Cognitive history with ghost branches

### Key Concepts
- **Heterarchical UI**: Agents emit hints about how they want to be rendered
- **LOD (Level of Detail)**: Semantic zoom from orbit→surface→internal
- **Entropy → Visual**: Deterministic mapping of uncertainty to distortion
- **The Shadow**: Rejected hypotheses shown as ghost branches

## Jokes (Session 11)

**Q: Why did the DensityField go to therapy?**
A: It had too much pressure and couldn't stop pulsing.

**Q: What did the Glitch widget say to clean code?**
A: "Y̸̧o̷u̶'̵l̸l̴ ̸b̷e̶ ̵b̴a̶c̸k̷.̶"

**Q: Why is LOD the best zoom?**
A: It doesn't just get closer—it gets *wiser*.

**Q: What's the BranchTree's favorite game?**
A: "What If?" — but it already knows all the answers.

**Q: Why did the Sparkline break up with the bar chart?**
A: "You're just too... thick."

**Q: How does the Shadow introduce itself?**
A: "I'm everything you chose not to be."

**Q: What did the Entropy widget say at the party?**
A: "Things are about to get... c̸̯̒h̷̰̑a̶̰͝o̵̜͌t̶̰̚i̵̱c̶̮͛."

**Q: Why is FluxScreen the best first date?**
A: It shows you everyone at a glance before you commit.

**Q: What do you call an I-gent that's been running too long?**
A: A b̷̛̮l̵͇̓u̶͔r̴̰̍.̴̱̌

## The Perfect Demo: "60 Seconds of I-gent"

**0:00** — Launch `kg viz` -> FluxScreen appears with 6 agent cards
**0:10** — Hover K-gent -> density field pulses, activity sparkline shows
**0:20** — Press 'g' -> trigger glitch, watch Zalgo spread
**0:25** — Drag LOD slider -> smooth zoom to Cockpit
**0:35** — Adjust temperature slider -> watch connections rearrange
**0:45** — Press '4' -> Loom screen, cognitive tree with ghost branches
**0:55** — Navigate with h/j/k/l -> explore "the Shadow"
**1:00** — "And that's how agents become weather, not boxes."

---

## Implementation Priority

### Immediate (Today)

1. `kg sparkline` — Already have the widget, just need CLI wrapper
2. `kg weather` — One-liner agent status using density chars
3. `kg glitch` — Apply glitch.py to arbitrary text

### This Week

4. `kg viz` — Launch demo_all_screens.py from CLI
5. **Entropy Playground** — Interactive slider + text distortion
6. **LOD Slider** — Smooth transition between views

### Portfolio Pieces

7. **FluxScreen Polish** — Make the demo screenshot-worthy
8. **Loom Navigator** — Full keyboard-driven tree exploration
9. **Error Flash** — System-wide glitch on errors

---

## Key Insight

I-gent isn't just visualization—it's **making cognition visible**. The Shadow shows what you didn't choose. The density field shows thinking as weather. The Loom shows time as topology.

**The Philosophy**: "Agents are currents of cognition, not boxes on a screen."
