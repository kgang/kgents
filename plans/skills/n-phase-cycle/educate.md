# Skill: EDUCATE (N-Phase Cycle)

> Teach humans and agents how to wield the shipped capability.

**Difficulty**: Easy  
**Prerequisites**: `test.md`, user journey knowledge, docs style guides  
**Files Touched**: docs/, prompts/, plans/skills/, release notes

---

## Overview
EDUCATE converts validated behavior into accessible guidance (operator guides, prompts, demos). It fulfills Ethical and Joy-Inducing principles by preserving agency and delight.

---

## Step-by-Step

1. **Audience mapping**: Identify personas (operator, maintainer, contributor) and their AGENTESE contexts.  
2. **Artifacts**: Update docs, quickstarts, prompts, and demo data using pre-computed richness. Highlight degraded-mode behavior and safety notes.  
3. **Support scripts**: Add helper CLI snippets or `kg` invocations; ensure observability cues align with Transparent Infrastructure.

## Recursive Hologram
- PLAN→RESEARCH→DEVELOP the docs themselves: what minimum grammar communicates the capability?  
- Use `meta-skill-operad.md` to keep documentation morphisms composable (snippets as reusable arrows).

---

## Verification
- Documentation/prompt updates land with runnable examples.  
- Warnings, degraded paths, and personality coordinates noted.  
- Users can reproduce validated behaviors without inside knowledge.

---

## Hand-off
Next: `measure.md` to track whether education changed outcomes.
