# Skill: STRATEGIZE (N-Phase Cycle)

> Choose the order of moves that maximizes leverage and resilience.

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Prerequisites**: `develop.md`, `plans/principles.md` (attention budgeting)  
**Files Touched**: sprint notes, plan chunk sequencing, risk/impact matrix

---

## Overview
STRATEGIZE translates design into a path: which chunks land first, what runs in parallel, and how to minimize risk. It aligns with Heterarchical and Transparent Infrastructure principles—leadership is contextual and communication is explicit.

---

## Step-by-Step

1. **Prioritize by leverage**: Sequence chunks by impact/effort and dependency graph; reserve Accursed Share buffer.  
2. **Parallelize safely**: Identify parallel tracks with clear interfaces and ownership (human/agent).  
3. **Define signals**: Establish checkpoints, metrics to watch early, and decision gates for CROSS-SYNERGIZE and IMPLEMENT.
4. **Run an oblique lookback**: Execute `lookback-revision.md` on the strategy to surface frame errors/double-loop shifts before locking the order.

---

## Recursive Hologram
- Mini-cycle the strategy itself: PLAN (goal), RESEARCH (constraints), DEVELOP (ordering), STRATEGIZE (revision).  
- Use `meta-skill-operad.md` to treat strategy as morphisms; ensure refactors preserve composition (no orphaned chunks).

---

## Verification
- Ordered backlog with owners, dependencies, and checkpoints.  
- Parallel tracks identified with interfaces.  
- Ready to discover combinations in CROSS-SYNERGIZE.

---

## Hand-off
Next: `cross-synergize.md` to explore compositions and entanglements.
