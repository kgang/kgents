# Skill: CROSS-SYNERGIZE (N-Phase Cycle)

> Discover compositions and entanglements that unlock nonlinear value.

**Difficulty**: Medium  
**Prerequisites**: `strategize.md`, composability laws (spec/principles.md §5)  
**Files Touched**: design notes, prototype pipelines, agent registries

---

## Overview
CROSS-SYNERGIZE tests combinations across agents, functors, and puppets to find lifts greater than the sum of parts. It enforces Composable and Generative principles—pipelines are derived, not enumerated.

---

## Step-by-Step

1. **Enumerate candidate morphisms**: List possible compositions (agent pipelines, operad operations, puppet swaps).  
2. **Probe fast**: Build micro-prototypes or dry-runs; prefer hotdata fixtures to avoid speculative LLM loops.  
3. **Select and freeze**: Choose compositions that satisfy laws (identity/associativity) and do not violate Ethical/Tasteful constraints.

---

## Recursive Hologram
- Apply PLAN→RESEARCH→DEVELOP on the set of compositions: Which deserve deeper development? Which are void/entropy exploration?  
- Use `meta-skill-operad.md` to register new operations; ensure they remain valid under future mutations (operad closure).

---

## Verification
- Chosen compositions documented with rationale and constraints.
- Rejected paths noted (to avoid rework).
- Implementation-ready interfaces defined.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **Skipping CROSS-SYNERGIZE entirely**: This phase finds leverage. Missing it means missing 2x-10x value multipliers.
- **Enumerating instead of generating**: Per AD-003, define grammars, not lists. If you're writing 600 commands, you're doing it wrong.
- **Ignoring law violations**: Compositions that break identity/associativity will fail downstream. Check laws in prototype.
- **Speculative LLM loops**: Use hotdata fixtures for probing. Don't burn tokens on exploratory combinations.
- **No rejected paths documentation**: Future sessions will re-explore dead ends. Write down what didn't work and why.

## Hand-off
Next: `implement.md` with selected compositions and constraints.
