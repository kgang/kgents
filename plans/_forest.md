---

## Executive Summary

The forest has undergone **The Great Extinction** (2025-12-21): Town, Park, Gestalt, Forge, Coalition, Muse, Gardener removed. ~52K lines archived. Post-extinction, **Hypergraph Emacs** emerged as a major deliverable (2025-12-22/23).

- **Active Plans**: 16 (down from 18 pre-extinction)
- **Active Crown Jewels**: Brain (100%), Witness (98%), Atelier (75%), Liminal (50%)
- **Dominant Theme**: **Hypergraph Navigation** — modal editing, graph visualization, EDGE mode
- **Major Delivery**: Hypergraph Emacs core complete (six-mode editor, SpecGraph visualizer)

## General Trends

### 0. Hypergraph Emacs Emergence (NEW)

The Hypergraph Emacs vision crystallized and was implemented in a single arc (2025-12-22/23):

**Delivered:**
- Six-mode modal editor (NORMAL, INSERT, EDGE, VISUAL, COMMAND, WITNESS)
- CodeMirror 6 with custom STARK BIOME theme
- SpecGraph Visualizer using Reactflow with tier-based coloring
- EDGE mode for creating typed edges between nodes
- Graph navigation: gh/gl (parent/child), gj/gk (siblings), gd/gr/gt (definition/references/tests)

**Remaining:**
- Portal operations (zo/zc for inline expansion)
- WITNESS mode bindings
- K-Block commit flow (:w)

This is now the primary UI surface for kgents self-hosting.

### 1. Witness Dominance

**8 of 16 plans** (50%) are Witness-related:
- Witness Crystallization (complete)
- Witness Dashboard TUI (complete)
- Witness Fusion UX Design + Implementation
- Witness Assurance Protocol + UI
- Visual Trail Graph (Trail → Witness bridge)
- Memory-First Docs (Teaching → Crystal → Witness)

**Interpretation**: Witness is becoming the central nervous system. Every action leaves a mark. Every mark becomes evidence.

### 2. From Crown Jewels to Evidence Ladder

Pre-extinction: 6 Crown Jewels competing for attention
Post-extinction: 4 Crown Jewels organized on an **Evidence Ladder**:

```
L3: Economic Bet (ASHC)
L2: Formal Proof (ASHC)
L1: Automated Test
L0: Human Mark (Witness)
L-1: TraceWitness
L-2: PromptAncestor ← NEW (Prompt Archaeology)
L-∞: Orphan (untracked artifacts)
```

### 3. Trust Surfaces Over Dashboards

Three plans explicitly reject "dashboard as spreadsheet":
- **Witness Assurance UI**: Garden metaphor, plants bloom/wilt
- **Dawn Cockpit**: ZenPortal patterns, not generic TUI
- **Stark Biome**: Industrial stillness, 10% earned glow

*"The persona is a garden, not a museum."*

### 4. Prompt Archaeology Emergence

A new discipline is crystallizing:
- **Total Provenance**: Every artifact traces to its generating prompt
- **Fitness Metrics**: test pass rate + correction rate + crystal formation
- **Self-Improvement Loops**: TextGRAD-style prompt evolution

This wasn't in the pre-extinction forest. It's new.

### 5. Technical Debt Acknowledged

183 mypy errors, 229 ESLint warnings. The `technical-debt-remediation.md` plan exists but sits at Tier 4. This is intentional — feature velocity over cleanliness during rapid development.

## What's NOT Here Anymore

Post-Extinction Removal (2025-12-21):
- **Town** — Citizens, dialogue, coalitions
- **Park** — Idea harvesting, cultivation
- **Gestalt** — Archetypal patterns
- **Forge** — Creation flows
- **Coalition** — Group dynamics
- **Muse** — Inspiration engine
- **Gardener** — System maintenance

These concepts are archived in git, and their teaching moments are being crystallized via Memory-First Docs.

## Recommended Next Session

Based on status and dependencies:

### Hypergraph Emacs Phase 4 (Continue Current Arc)
1. `hypergraph-emacs.md` Phase 4 — Portal operations (zo/zc), WITNESS mode bindings
2. `hypergraph-emacs.md` Phase 5 — K-Block commit flow (:w saves)

### Quick Wins (< 3 hrs)
3. `dawn-phase-4-kickoff.md` — j/k nav, copy confirmation, add modal
4. `stark-biome-enforcement.md` — ESLint rule, selective migration

### Medium Investment (1-2 sessions)
5. `witness-fusion-ux-implementation.md` Session 1 — Component primitives
6. `memory-first-docs-execution.md` Phase 2B — Bootstrap script + CLI

### Major Arc (multi-session)
7. `witness-assurance-protocol.md` — Full evidence ladder infrastructure

## Bounty Board Sync

From `_bounty.md`, relevant open bounties:
- **[HIGH]** CLI handlers bypass AGENTESE — route through logos.invoke()
- **[HIGH]** Cross-jewel synergy bus — CRYSTAL_FORMED events
- **[HIGH]** Observer unification — O/N/T-gent → ObserverFunctor

These align with Witness Assurance work (synergy bus, evidence events).

---

## Verification

```bash
# Count active plans
ls -1 plans/*.md | grep -v "^plans/_" | wc -l
# → 16 (excluding _bounty.md, _focus.md, meta.md, README.md)

# Test counts (approximate)
cd impl/claude && uv run pytest --collect-only -q 2>/dev/null | tail -1
# → X tests collected
```

## Anti-Sausage Check

Reviewing this forest, I ask:
- **Daring?** Yes — Witness as central nervous system is bold
- **Bold?** Yes — Extinction removed 52K lines without regret
- **Creative?** Yes — Garden metaphor, prompt archaeology, evidence ladder
- **Not gaudy?** Yes — Plans are terse, focused, actionable

The voice is preserved.
