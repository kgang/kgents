## The Seven Jewel Crown (Project KPIs)

> Progress on these apps—and the elegance of their execution—defines our project-level KPIs above everything else.
>
> **2025-12-15 EVOLUTION**: Expanded from 6 to 7 jewels with The Gardener. New mandates: AGENTESE-first, strict autopoiesis.

## Session Attention Budget (Suggested)

Per `plans/principles.md` §3:

```
Primary Focus (60%):    [your choice from Active Trees]
Secondary (25%):        [another Active Tree]
Maintenance (10%):      [check in on Blocked/Dormant]
Accursed Share (5%):    agents/t-gent (rotation)
```
