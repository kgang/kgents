# Forest Health: 2025-12-23

> *"The persona is a garden, not a museum."*

## Executive Summary

**Post-Archive Clarity**: 7 plans archived (3 complete, 4 superseded). The forest is leaner.

The dominant arc is **Embodiment** — the frontend IS the agent now, not a documentation shell. Hypergraph Emacs and The Membrane are the primary surfaces.

- **Active Plans**: 21 (down from 28)
- **Active Crown Jewels**: Brain (100%), Witness (98%), Atelier (75%), Liminal (50%)
- **Dominant Theme**: Hypergraph Navigation + Witness Integration
- **Major Delivery**: Hypergraph Emacs core (six-mode editor, SpecGraph visualizer)

## Trends & Observations

### 1. From Documentation to Embodiment

The major shift: **Stop building UIs *about* agents. Build UIs that *are* agents.**

- Old: NavigationTree, PathBrowser, PolynomialDiagram (documentation)
- New: Hypergraph Emacs (you navigate *in* the graph), Membrane (you think *with* the agent)

This is the realization of *"The proof IS the decision."*

### 2. Witness as Central Nervous System

8 of 21 active plans touch Witness:
- Fusion UX (design + impl)
- Assurance Protocol + UI
- Visual Trail Graph (Trail → Witness bridge)
- Memory-First Docs (Teaching → Crystal → Witness)
- Inbound Sovereignty (witnessed ingestion)

### 3. Quick Wins Available

Two plans are < 3 hours each:
- `dawn-phase-4-kickoff.md` — j/k nav, copy confirmation, add modal
- `stark-biome-enforcement.md` — ESLint rule + selective migration

Good session-starters for momentum.

### 4. Technical Debt Acknowledged

183 mypy errors (mostly manifest signature mismatches). The debt is *known* and *deferred*—feature velocity prioritized during rapid development.

## Recommended Next Session

### Continue Current Arc
1. `hypergraph-emacs.md` Phase 4 — Portal operations (zo/zc for inline expansion)
2. `_inbound-sovereignty.md` Session 3 — Sync Protocol

### Quick Wins (< 3 hrs)
3. `dawn-phase-4-kickoff.md` — j/k nav, copy confirmation, add modal
4. `stark-biome-enforcement.md` — ESLint rule, selective migration

### Medium Investment (1-2 sessions)
5. `witness-fusion-ux-implementation.md` Session 1 — Component primitives
6. `memory-first-docs-execution.md` Phase 2B — Bootstrap script + CLI

### Major Arc (multi-session)
7. `witness-assurance-protocol.md` — Full evidence ladder infrastructure

## Bounty Board Sync

From `_bounty.md`, relevant open bounties:
- **[HIGH]** CLI handlers bypass AGENTESE — route through logos.invoke()
- **[HIGH]** Cross-jewel synergy bus — CRYSTAL_FORMED events
- **[HIGH]** Observer unification — O/N/T-gent → ObserverFunctor

These align with Witness Assurance and Inbound Sovereignty work.

## Anti-Sausage Check

Reviewing this forest:
- **Daring?** Yes — Hypergraph Emacs is a novel editor paradigm
- **Bold?** Yes — 67K lines burned, 7 plans archived without regret
- **Creative?** Yes — Graph-as-UI, Witness-as-nervous-system, Evidence Ladder
- **Not gaudy?** Yes — Plans are terse, focused, actionable

The voice is preserved.
