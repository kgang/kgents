## Session Attention Budget (Suggested)

Per `plans/principles.md` §3:

```
Primary Focus (60%):    [your choice from Active Trees]
Secondary (25%):        [another Active Tree]
Maintenance (10%):      [check in on Blocked/Dormant]
Accursed Share (5%):    agents/t-gent (rotation)
```

## Forest Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total trees | 95 |
| Active | 62 (65%) |
| Dormant | 19 (20%) |
| Blocked | 0 (0%) |
| Archived | 6 (new today) |
| Average progress | 10% |
| Longest untouched | agents/t-gent (2 days) |
| Accursed share next | agents/t-gent |
