# WASM Survivors: Enlightened Edition

> *"After two waves, you realize: they're not individuals. They're a hive mind. And they're learning."*

**Status**: Proposal | **Author**: CREATIVE + Kent | **Date**: 2025-12-27

## The Vision

A survivors-like where:
1. **The game watches you** and adapts to your patterns
2. **Your deaths become seeds** for future runs
3. **The enemies are a hive mind** that evolves the longer they survive

The third insight is the game-changer: **enemies aren't obstacles—they're a collective intelligence racing to metamorphose before you kill them.**

---

## Part I: The Hive Mind

### The Revelation (Wave 2)

The first two waves feel normal. Basic enemies chase. You kill them.

Then something happens. An enemy you've been kiting for 15 seconds starts *pulsing*. Others nearby change direction—not toward you, but toward the pulsing one. They merge. What emerges is something new.

**The moment of realization**: They're not individuals. They're a hive mind. And you just let them combine.

### Core Mechanic: Metamorphosis

> *"Kill them fast, or watch them become something you can't imagine."*

**The Rule**: Enemies that survive long enough on screen combine into **Mutant Colossals**—mega-enemies with epic movesets that single enemies could never perform.

| Survival Time | What Happens |
|---------------|--------------|
| 0-10s | Normal behavior |
| 10-15s | Pulsing begins—seeking combination partners |
| 15-20s | Gravitates toward other pulsing enemies |
| 20s+ | **Metamorphosis** if 2+ pulsing enemies touch |

**The Pressure**: You're not just surviving. You're racing against metamorphosis. Every enemy you fail to kill is a tick toward catastrophe.

### Mutant Variants

> *"Any enemy can be born different. And different changes everything."*

**Base Rule**: Every spawned enemy has a chance to be a **Mutant** variant.

| Variant | Visual Tell | Behavior Change |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|
| Normal | Standard color | Standard behavior |
| Mutant | Slightly glowing outline | Same behavior, but... |

**Mutant in Colossal**: When a Mutant enemy participates in metamorphosis, the resulting Colossal is **slightly faster** than normal. Stack multiple mutants = significantly faster.

This creates emergent priority: **Kill mutants first, or the Colossal will be a nightmare.**

### Themed Metamorphoses

> *"Each enemy type transforms into something categorically different."*

The metamorphosis isn't random. It's **themed by the dominant enemy type** in the combination.

---

## The Five Metamorphoses

### 1. Shambler Colossal: THE TIDE

**Input**: 3+ Shamblers combine

**Theme**: Overwhelming inevitability. The thing that cannot be stopped.

**Visual**: A massive, slow-moving wave of flesh. Multiple shambler bodies fused into a rolling wall.

**Moveset**:
| Move | Description | Counter |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Inexorable Advance** | Moves toward player at 0.5x speed but CANNOT be slowed | Kite perpendicular |
| **Absorption** | Any enemy that touches it is absorbed, healing it | Clear the field first |
| **Fission** | At 25% HP, splits into 5 shamblers | Burst it down fast |
| **Gravity Well** | Nearby enemies accelerate toward you when near Tide | Don't fight near mobs |

**The Fantasy**: You're not fighting an enemy. You're fleeing a natural disaster.

---

### 2. Rusher Colossal: THE RAMPAGE

**Input**: 3+ Rushers combine

**Theme**: Unstoppable kinetic force. The thing that never stops moving.

**Visual**: A blur of limbs and fury. Multiple rusher bodies fused into a perpetual-motion engine.

**Moveset**:
| Move | Description | Counter |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Pinball** | Bounces off arena walls, accelerating each bounce | Predict trajectory |
| **Aftershock** | Leaves damage trail during charges | Don't follow |
| **Momentum Transfer** | Hitting you launches you across arena | Brace near walls |
| **Redline** | Below 50% HP, charge cooldown halves | Burst or run |

**The Fantasy**: You're a matador. One wrong step and you're paste.

---

### 3. Spitter Colossal: THE ARTILLERY

**Input**: 3+ Spitters combine

**Theme**: Ranged supremacy. The thing that controls the entire arena.

**Visual**: A floating mass of eyes and mouths. Multiple spitter bodies fused into a weapons platform.

**Moveset**:
| Move | Description | Counter |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Barrage** | Fires 12 projectiles in a spread | Weave through gaps |
| **Mortar** | Lobs slow projectile that explodes in AoE | Watch the shadow |
| **Suppression** | Continuous fire that tracks your movement | Break the pattern |
| **Air Burst** | Projectiles detonate mid-flight into clusters | Stay close (risky) |

**The Fantasy**: You're in a bullet hell. The arena is the enemy.

---

### 4. Tank Colossal: THE FORTRESS

**Input**: 3+ Tanks combine

**Theme**: Immovable defense. The thing that makes YOU come to IT.

**Visual**: A walking mountain. Multiple tank bodies fused into a mobile stronghold.

**Moveset**:
| Move | Description | Counter |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Siege Mode** | Stops moving, spawns defensive turrets | Flank and burst |
| **Quake** | Ground pound damages entire arena (less damage at range) | Stay far |
| **Magnetize** | Pulls all XP orbs toward itself (heals on collect) | Race for XP |
| **Bunker** | At 25% HP, becomes invulnerable for 5s, spawns adds | DPS race |

**The Fantasy**: You're storming a castle. Every approach has a cost.

---

### 5. Swarm Colossal: THE LEGION

**Input**: 5+ Swarm enemies combine (smaller enemies, more needed)

**Theme**: Coordinated multiplicity. The thing that's everywhere at once.

**Visual**: A seething mass of tiny bodies that moves as one. Not merged—synchronized.

**Moveset**:
| Move | Description | Counter |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Scatter** | Disperses into 20 micro-enemies, reforms after 5s | AoE or flee |
| **Encircle** | Forms a ring around you, constricting | Dash through |
| **Drone Strike** | Sends 3 suicide bombers at you | Kite into each other |
| **Hivemind** | All nearby enemies gain +50% speed when Legion is alive | Priority target |

**The Fantasy**: You're surrounded. The hive is closing in.

---

## Hybrid Colossals (Advanced)

> *"When different types combine, something truly unexpected emerges."*

If metamorphosis involves **multiple enemy types**, the Colossal inherits abilities from both—but twisted.

| Combination | Hybrid Colossal | Signature Move |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Shambler + Rusher | **THE AVALANCHE** | Slow approach, then sudden charge |
| Rusher + Spitter | **THE STRAFING RUN** | Fires while charging |
| Spitter + Tank | **THE BUNKER** | Stationary but covered in turrets |
| Tank + Swarm | **THE HIVE QUEEN** | Armored core spawning endless adds |
| Swarm + Shambler | **THE MIGRATION** | Slow-moving swarm that never stops growing |

**Discovery**: Players must EXPERIENCE these combinations to learn them. No tooltip. No warning. Just "oh god what is THAT."

---

## The Hive Mind's Intelligence

### Collective Learning

> *"They're not just combining. They're learning from each other."*

**Mechanic**: The hive mind shares information across all active enemies.

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Pattern Propagation** | If one enemy learns your dodge pattern, ALL enemies adjust |
| **Sacrifice Awareness** | Enemies know when one of them is about to die—others accelerate |
| **Colossal Priority** | When a Colossal exists, lesser enemies become supports, not attackers |
| **Death Knowledge** | The hive remembers which attacks killed YOU—uses them more |

**The Implication**: The longer the run, the smarter they get. Wave 10's basic shamblers are more dangerous than wave 1's because they've learned from watching.

### Visual Language of the Hive

| State | Visual |
|-------|--------|
| Individual | Normal behavior, isolated movement |
| Pulsing | Glowing outline, seeking combination |
| Linked | Visible energy threads between nearby enemies |
| Pre-Metamorphosis | Flash of light, bodies gravitating together |
| Colossal Active | All lesser enemies gain subtle hive glow |

---

## Part II: The Witness Systems

*(Incorporated from PROTO_SPEC_ENLIGHTENED)*

### Adaptive Witness

The game watches YOU the same way the hive watches you:

| Feature | Hive Parallel |
|---------|---------------|
| Pattern Recognition | Both the game AND enemies learn your dodge patterns |
| Personalized Feedback | "You always dodge left—the HIVE knows this" |
| Style Fingerprinting | "The hive has classified you as an Aggressive Orbiter" |

**Narrative Synergy**: The witness layer and the hive mind are the same thing. The game is the hive. The hive is watching.

### Crystal Inheritance

Your crystals now include hive data:

| Crystal Data | New Meaning |
|--------------|-------------|
| Death cause | Which Colossal killed you and how |
| Metamorphosis count | How many Colossals spawned before you died |
| Hive intelligence level | How smart the hive got during your run |
| Closest call | The Colossal you almost let form |

**Inheritance Option**: "Start run with hive at intelligence level 3" (for challenge seekers)

### Ritual Death

When killed by a Colossal, the crystallization ritual shows:

- The Colossal that killed you (rotating 3D view)
- The enemies that formed it (decomposition view)
- How long they survived before combining (your failure window)
- What you could have done ("Kill the mutant first next time")

## Part III: Design Laws

### Metamorphosis Laws

| Law | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **M1 Predictable Timer** | Players must be able to learn how long until metamorphosis |
| **M2 Visual Warning** | Pulsing enemies are OBVIOUS—this is a skill test, not a trap |
| **M3 Interruptible** | Killing ANY pulsing enemy resets nearby enemies' timers |
| **M4 Escapable** | Colossals can be run from. Slow but powerful. |
| **M5 Soloable** | Every Colossal can be killed with base stats. Skill ceiling is infinite. |

### Hive Mind Laws

| Law | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **H1 Fair Learning** | Hive learns from success, not failure. If you dodge it, they adapt. |
| **H2 Reset Between Runs** | Hive intelligence resets each run. No cross-run punishment. |
| **H3 Visible Intelligence** | HUD shows hive awareness level (subtle, not invasive) |
| **H4 Counterplay Exists** | Every hive behavior has a counter. Adaptation is a puzzle, not a wall. |

### Colossal Laws

| Law | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **C1 Telegraphed Moves** | Every Colossal attack has a long, readable wind-up |
| **C2 Cooldown Windows** | After each attack, Colossals are vulnerable |
| **C3 One at a Time** | Maximum one Colossal per wave (early game) |
| **C4 Boss-Level Reward** | Killing a Colossal grants significant XP + guaranteed upgrade |

---

## Part IV: The Player Experience

### The Emotional Arc

| Phase | Experience | Hive State |
|-------|------------|------------|
| **Wave 1-2** | "Normal survivors game" | Dormant |
| **Wave 2 Metamorphosis** | "WHAT WAS THAT" | First reveal |
| **Wave 3-5** | "Kill fast or die" | Active pressure |
| **Wave 6-8** | "I understand the patterns" | Player mastery |
| **Wave 9+** | "The hive knows me" | Mutual adaptation |

### The "One More Run" Factors

| Factor | Hive Enhancement |
|--------|------------------|
| Near-miss deaths | "I almost killed the mutant in time" |
| Discovery moments | "I've never seen THAT Colossal before" |
| Skill expression | "I prevented metamorphosis for 3 waves straight" |
| Emergent strategy | "If I let THESE combine, the Colossal is easier" |
| Personal narrative | "The hive is specifically adapting to MY playstyle" |

## The Pitch

> *"A survivors-like where the enemies are a hive mind racing to evolve before you can kill them. Let them live too long and they combine into Colossals with movesets no individual enemy could perform. The hive learns your patterns. The hive adapts. And every run, the hive remembers what killed you—and uses it.*
>
> *You're not fighting enemies. You're fighting an intelligence. And it's watching.*"

---

## The Mirror Test

> *"Does this feel like Kent on his best day?"*

**Daring**: Hive mind enemies that actually learn and adapt.
**Bold**: Metamorphosis as core mechanic, not gimmick.
**Creative**: Colossals as emergent boss fights, not scripted encounters.
**Opinionated**: The hive and the witness are the same. The game is the enemy.
**Not gaudy**: Every system serves the core tension: kill fast or face metamorphosis.

---

## Open Questions

1. **Metamorphosis timer length**: 20s feels right, but needs playtesting
2. **Colossal XP value**: Should it be worth 10 enemies? 20?
3. **Mutant spawn rate**: 10%? 5%? Too many = constant crisis
4. **Hybrid rarity**: Should players ever see hybrids, or are they mythic?
5. **Hive intelligence cap**: Does learning plateau, or endless escalation?

*"They're not just enemies. They're a mirror. And they're learning faster than you."*
