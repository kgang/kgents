# Pilot Bootstrap Protocol

> *"From axioms to laws in one day. From spec to witness in one session."*

**Status**: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (2025-01-10)
**Date**: 2025-01-10
**Priority**: P2 (Enabling)
**Scope**: Protocol for bootstrapping arbitrary intellectual endeavors
**Related**: `coherence-synthesis-master.md`, `zero-seed-integration.md`

---

## Executive Summary

This protocol enables anyone to bootstrap a new pilot (project, endeavor, domain) using the kgents theoretical foundations. It provides a step-by-step guide from axiom discovery through law derivation, ensuring coherence with Zero Seed, Constitutional OS, and the Five Universal Law Schemas.

### The Promise

> **Given any intellectual endeavor, this protocol produces:**
> - Axioms (L < 0.10) — immutable foundations
> - Values (L < 0.35) — derived principles
> - Specifications (L < 0.70) — implementation choices
> - Tuning (L ≥ 0.70) — variable parameters
> - Pilot Laws — domain-specific instantiations of the Five Schemas

### Time to First Laws

| Phase | Time | Output |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1. Axiom Discovery | 1-2 hours | 2-4 axioms with Galois validation |
| 2. Value Derivation | 1 hour | 3-5 values derived from axioms |
| 3. Specification | 2 hours | Layer assignments for all content |
| 4. Law Derivation | 1-2 hours | 5 laws (one per schema) |
| **Total** | **5-7 hours** | **Complete pilot foundation** |

---

## Part I: Prerequisite Understanding

### The Galois Stratification (Kent-Calibrated)

All content stratifies by Galois loss using the **canonical 5-tier evidence system**:

| Tier | Threshold | Modal | Meaning |
|------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **CATEGORICAL** | L < 0.10 | MUST | Axiom-level, fixed points. Survive radical restructuring. |
| **EMPIRICAL** | L < 0.38 | SHOULD | Strong evidence. Values derived from axioms. |
| **AESTHETIC** | L < 0.45 | MAY | Kent sees derivation paths. Specs with justification. |
| **SOMATIC** | L < 0.65 | MAY | Felt sense, Mirror test. Implementation choices. |
| **CHAOTIC** | L ≥ 0.65 | WILL | Tuning parameters. Change freely during development. |

For simplified reasoning, use the **4-layer mapping**:
- **Axiom** (L < 0.10): CATEGORICAL tier
- **Value** (0.10 ≤ L < 0.38): EMPIRICAL tier
- **Spec** (0.38 ≤ L < 0.65): AESTHETIC + SOMATIC tiers
- **Tuning** (L ≥ 0.65): CHAOTIC tier

### The Five Universal Law Schemas

All pilot laws derive from these five patterns:

| Schema | Pattern | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **COHERENCE_GATE** | X is valid only if Y is marked | "Run is valid only if every build shift is witnessed" |
| **DRIFT_ALERT** | If loss > threshold, surface it | "If quality drops below baseline, alert" |
| **GHOST_PRESERVATION** | Unchosen paths remain inspectable | "Rejected alternatives stay accessible" |
| **COURAGE_PRESERVATION** | High-risk acts protected from penalty | "Bold choices aren't punished" |
| **COMPRESSION_HONESTY** | Compression discloses what was dropped | "Summary says what it omitted" |

### The Seven Constitutional Principles

Laws align with constitutional principles:

| Schema | Primary Principle | Type | Threshold/Weight |
|--------|-------------------|------|------------------|
| *All schemas* | ETHICAL | **GATE** | ≥ 0.6 (Amendment A) |
| COHERENCE_GATE | COMPOSABLE | Weight | 1.5 |
| DRIFT_ALERT | GENERATIVE | Weight | 1.0 |
| GHOST_PRESERVATION | HETERARCHICAL | Weight | 1.0 |
| COURAGE_PRESERVATION | JOY_INDUCING | Weight | 1.2 |
| COMPRESSION_HONESTY | CURATED | Weight | 1.0 |

**Note**: ETHICAL is a **gate** that applies to ALL schemas. Any law that violates ethical constraints (transparency, privacy, human agency) fails immediately, regardless of schema compliance.

## Part II: Phase 1 — Axiom Discovery

### 2.1 The Process

```
AXIOM DISCOVERY PROTOCOL

1. Domain Declaration
   - What is the endeavor?
   - What would success look like?
   - What would failure look like?

2. Invariant Identification
   - What MUST hold regardless of implementation?
   - What would break everything if violated?
   - What survives all valid variations?

3. Mirror Test
   - "Does this feel true on your best day?"
   - If hesitation: not an axiom
   - If immediate: candidate axiom

4. Galois Validation
   - Compute L(candidate)
   - If L < 0.10: confirmed axiom (CATEGORICAL tier)
   - If 0.10 ≤ L < 0.38: value candidate (EMPIRICAL tier)
   - If L ≥ 0.38: demote to spec or tuning

5. Record Axiom
   - Statement: one sentence
   - Derivation: from what kernel primitive?
   - Test: how would you verify violation?
   - Loss: computed Galois loss
```

### 2.2 Axiom Template

```markdown
### A[N]: [AXIOM NAME] (L = [loss])

**Statement**: [One sentence stating the invariant]

**Derivation**: [From which kernel primitive? L0.1 Entity, L0.2 Morphism, L1.x, etc.]

**Test**: [How would you verify a violation?]

**Implications**:
- [What follows from this axiom?]
- [What does this prohibit?]
- [What does this enable?]
```

### 2.3 Example: Academic Paper Writing Lab

```markdown
### A1: INTELLECTUAL HONESTY (L = 0.03)

**Statement**: Every claim must be supported by evidence or explicit derivation.

**Derivation**: L0.2 (Morphism) — claims are arrows from evidence to conclusions.

**Test**: For any claim C, there exists a traceable path E → C where E is evidence.

**Implications**:
- No unsupported assertions
- Citation or derivation for every claim
- "I believe" statements must be marked as opinion


### A2: COMPOSITIONAL ARGUMENT (L = 0.05)

**Statement**: Sections compose into a coherent narrative; removing any section leaves the remainder coherent.

**Derivation**: L1.1 (Compose) — (section >> section) >> paper = section >> (section >> paper).

**Test**: Delete any section. Does the remaining paper still make sense?

**Implications**:
- No orphan sections
- Each section serves the whole
- Modular structure


### A3: READER RESPECT (L = 0.08)

**Statement**: The paper is written for the reader's understanding, not the author's convenience.

**Derivation**: L0.3 (Mirror) — the paper must pass the reader's felt sense test.

**Test**: Would a target reader understand this on first read?

**Implications**:
- Clear before clever
- Define before use
- Example before abstraction
```

## Part III: Phase 2 — Value Derivation

### 3.1 The Process

```
VALUE DERIVATION PROTOCOL

1. Axiom Combination
   - What emerges when axioms interact?
   - A1 + A2 → what principle?

2. Domain Application
   - What does each axiom mean for THIS endeavor?
   - What standards follow?

3. Aesthetic Integration
   - What would "daring, bold, creative" mean here?
   - What would "tasteful" mean here?

4. Loss Computation
   - Compute L(value)
   - Target: 0.10 ≤ L < 0.38 (EMPIRICAL tier)
   - If L < 0.10: might be an axiom (promote to CATEGORICAL)
   - If L ≥ 0.38: might be a spec (demote to AESTHETIC/SOMATIC)

5. Record Value
   - Statement: derived from which axioms
   - Loss: computed Galois loss
```

### 3.2 Value Template

```markdown
### V[N]: [VALUE NAME] (L = [loss])

**Statement**: [What principle does this encode?]

**Derivation**: [From which axioms? A1 + A2 → V1]

**Specification**:
```
[Pseudo-formal specification of what this value means]
```
```

### 3.3 Example: Academic Paper Values

```markdown
### V1: CLARITY (L = 0.18)

**Statement**: Every sentence should be understandable by a competent reader in the target audience.

**Derivation**: A3 (Reader Respect) + domain expertise assumption.

**Specification**:
```
Clarity: Sentence → {clear, unclear}
For each sentence s:
  If jargon: must be defined within 2 paragraphs
  If complex: must be broken down
  If ambiguous: must be disambiguated
```


### V2: ORIGINALITY (L = 0.25)

**Statement**: The paper must contribute something new to the field.

**Derivation**: A2 (Compositional Argument) + contribution requirement.

**Specification**:
```
Originality: Paper → {novel, derivative}
Paper is novel if:
  ∃ claim C where C is not found in prior work
  OR ∃ method M where M is new application
  OR ∃ result R where R contradicts or extends prior
```


### V3: RIGOR (L = 0.22)

**Statement**: Methods must be reproducible; conclusions must follow from evidence.

**Derivation**: A1 (Intellectual Honesty) + scientific method.

**Specification**:
```
Rigor: Section → {rigorous, hand-wavy}
A section is rigorous if:
  Methods can be replicated from description
  Data is available or access explained
  Statistics are appropriate and correct
  Conclusions don't overreach evidence
```
```

## Part IV: Phase 3 — Specification Layer

### 4.1 The Process

```
SPECIFICATION PROTOCOL

1. Implementation Survey
   - What choices have been made?
   - What could have been done differently?

2. Layer Assignment
   - For each choice: compute Galois loss
   - Assign to Axiom/Value/Spec/Tuning

3. Alternative Documentation
   - What alternatives exist?
   - Why was this choice made?

4. Record Specification
   - Current instantiation
   - Valid alternatives
   - Regeneration law
```

### 4.2 Specification Template

```markdown
### S[N]: [SPEC NAME] (L = [loss])

**Current Instantiation**: [What choice was made?]

**Abstract Pattern**: [What general pattern does this instantiate?]

**Why This Instantiation**:
- [Reason 1]
- [Reason 2]

**Valid Alternatives**:
- [Alternative 1]: [brief description]
- [Alternative 2]: [brief description]

**Regeneration Law**: [What constraints must any valid instantiation satisfy?]
```

### 4.3 Example: Academic Paper Specifications

```markdown
### S1: STRUCTURE (L = 0.45)

**Current Instantiation**: IMRAD (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion)

**Abstract Pattern**: A paper has a structured flow from context to contribution to implications.

**Why This Instantiation**:
- Standard in empirical sciences
- Familiar to reviewers
- Clear separation of concerns

**Valid Alternatives**:
- **Narrative**: Story-driven structure (humanities)
- **Thematic**: Organized by theme, not method
- **Problem-Solution**: State problem, propose solution, validate

**Regeneration Law**: Any structure that satisfies A2 (compositional) and A3 (reader respect) is valid.


### S2: CITATION STYLE (L = 0.62)

**Current Instantiation**: APA 7th edition

**Abstract Pattern**: Citations must be traceable and consistent.

**Why This Instantiation**:
- Required by target journal
- Well-documented

**Valid Alternatives**:
- IEEE, Chicago, MLA, journal-specific

**Regeneration Law**: Any consistent citation style that enables A1 (intellectual honesty) tracing.
```

## Part V: Phase 4 — Law Derivation

### 5.1 The Process

```
LAW DERIVATION PROTOCOL

For each of the Five Schemas:

1. Identify Domain Application
   - What does this schema mean for THIS endeavor?
   - What is X? What is Y? What is the threshold?

2. Formulate Predicate
   - What boolean check enforces this law?
   - What context is needed?

3. Determine Consequences
   - What happens on violation?
   - Is it a hard fail or soft warning?

4. Integrate with Principles
   - Which constitutional principle does this enforce?
   - What weight should violations carry?

5. Record Law
   - Name, description, predicate
   - Map to schema and principle
```

### 5.2 Law Template

```markdown
### L[N]: [LAW NAME]

**Schema**: [COHERENCE_GATE | DRIFT_ALERT | GHOST_PRESERVATION | COURAGE_PRESERVATION | COMPRESSION_HONESTY]

**Principle**: [COMPOSABLE | GENERATIVE | HETERARCHICAL | JOY_INDUCING | CURATED | etc.]

**Description**: [What does this law enforce?]

**Predicate**:
```python
def [law_name](**context) -> bool:
    """[Docstring explaining the check]"""
    [implementation]
```

**Violation Consequence**: [What happens if this fails?]
```

### 5.3 Example: Academic Paper Laws

```markdown
### L1: SECTION COHERENCE LAW

**Schema**: COHERENCE_GATE

**Principle**: COMPOSABLE (weight 1.5)

**Description**: A section is complete only when it has been reviewed against the paper's thesis.

**Predicate**:
```python
def section_coherence(
    section_complete: bool = False,
    thesis_reviewed: bool = False,
    **kwargs,
) -> bool:
    """Section is valid only if thesis coherence is verified."""
    return section_complete and thesis_reviewed
```

**Violation Consequence**: Section cannot be marked "done" until coherence check passes.


### L2: CLAIM EVIDENCE DRIFT LAW

**Schema**: DRIFT_ALERT

**Principle**: GENERATIVE (weight 1.0)

**Description**: If a claim's evidence support drops below threshold, surface it for repair.

**Predicate**:
```python
def claim_evidence_drift(
    claim_strength: float = 1.0,
    evidence_strength: float = 1.0,
    threshold: float = 0.7,
    surfaced: bool = True,
    **kwargs,
) -> bool:
    """Alert if evidence doesn't support claim strength."""
    support_ratio = evidence_strength / max(claim_strength, 0.01)
    if support_ratio < threshold:
        return surfaced  # Must be surfaced if drifting
    return True
```

**Violation Consequence**: Claim flagged for review; cannot proceed to submission.


### L3: REJECTED ARGUMENT PRESERVATION LAW

**Schema**: GHOST_PRESERVATION

**Principle**: HETERARCHICAL (weight 1.0)

**Description**: Arguments considered but not included remain in supplementary materials.

**Predicate**:
```python
def rejected_argument_preservation(
    rejected_arguments: list[str] | None = None,
    supplementary_arguments: list[str] | None = None,
    **kwargs,
) -> bool:
    """Rejected arguments must be preserved somewhere."""
    if not rejected_arguments:
        return True  # Nothing to preserve
    if supplementary_arguments is None:
        return False  # Arguments lost
    return all(arg in supplementary_arguments for arg in rejected_arguments)
```

**Violation Consequence**: Warning; may lose valuable context for future work.


### L4: BOLD CLAIM PROTECTION LAW

**Schema**: COURAGE_PRESERVATION

**Principle**: JOY_INDUCING (weight 1.2)

**Description**: Novel, daring claims are protected from reviewer pushback if well-evidenced.

**Predicate**:
```python
def bold_claim_protection(
    novelty_level: float = 0.0,  # 0-1, higher = bolder
    evidence_level: float = 0.0,  # 0-1, higher = stronger
    penalty_applied: float = 0.0,
    novelty_threshold: float = 0.7,
    evidence_threshold: float = 0.6,
    **kwargs,
) -> bool:
    """Bold claims with sufficient evidence shouldn't be penalized."""
    if novelty_level >= novelty_threshold:
        # This is a bold claim
        if evidence_level >= evidence_threshold:
            # Sufficiently evidenced: no penalty allowed
            return penalty_applied <= 0.0
    return True  # Non-bold claims: no protection needed
```

**Violation Consequence**: Reviewer feedback flagged as potentially overcautious.


### L5: ABSTRACT COMPRESSION HONESTY LAW

**Schema**: COMPRESSION_HONESTY

**Principle**: CURATED (weight 1.0)

**Description**: The abstract discloses scope limitations and what the paper does NOT cover.

**Predicate**:
```python
def abstract_compression_honesty(
    paper_topics: set[str] | None = None,
    abstract_topics: set[str] | None = None,
    disclosed_omissions: set[str] | None = None,
    **kwargs,
) -> bool:
    """Abstract must disclose what was omitted."""
    if not paper_topics:
        return True  # Nothing to compress

    abstract = abstract_topics or set()
    omitted = paper_topics - abstract

    if not omitted:
        return True  # Nothing omitted

    if disclosed_omissions is None:
        return False  # Omissions not disclosed

    return omitted <= disclosed_omissions  # All omissions disclosed
```

**Violation Consequence**: Abstract rejected; must add limitation statement.
```

| *All* | **ETHICAL** | **GATE** | — | ≥0.6 threshold |
| COHERENCE_GATE | COMPOSABLE | Weight | TASTEFUL | 1.5 |
| DRIFT_ALERT | GENERATIVE | Weight | CURATED | 1.0 |
| GHOST_PRESERVATION | HETERARCHICAL | Weight | — | 1.0 |
