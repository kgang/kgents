## The Vision in One Paragraph

The Constitutional Decision OS transforms human-AI collaboration through a radical premise: **semantic coherence is measurable**. Using the Galois Loss framework (L(P) = d(P, C(R(P)))), we can detect axioms (fixed points), surface contradictions (super-additivity), and assign epistemic layers (loss thresholds). **Five pilots validate this thesis** across gaming, consumer, creative, generative, and productivity domains—proving the Mark → Trace → Crystal spine works at millisecond to daily granularity. The path forward: ship **trail-to-crystal-daily-lab** first as the wedge pilot, then expand to Galois API and consumer products.

## The Five Pilots: Validation Infrastructure

| Pilot | Domain | Temporal Grain | Joy Dimension | Steel Thread Week |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **trail-to-crystal-daily-lab** | Productivity | Actions → Days | FLOW | Week 6 (FIRST) |
| **wasm-survivors-witnessed-run-lab** | Gaming | Microseconds → Runs | FLOW | Week 7 |
| **disney-portal-planner** | Consumer Travel | Hours → Days | WARMTH | Week 8 |
| **rap-coach-flow-lab** | Creative/Coaching | Takes → Sessions | SURPRISE | Week 7 |
| **sprite-procedural-taste-lab** | Generative Art | Mutations → Epochs | SURPRISE | Week 8 |

### Universal Primitives (ALL 5 pilots require)

| Primitive | Status | Coverage |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Mark (action → justification) | Required | 5/5 |
| Trace (immutable history) | Required | 5/5 |
| Crystal (compressed proof) | Required | 5/5 |
| Trail (navigation + compression) | Required | 5/5 |
| ValueCompass (principle radar) | Required | 5/5 |
| Galois Loss (coherence metric) | Required | 4/5 |

### The Wedge Pilot: trail-to-crystal-daily-lab

**Why this ships first**:
1. **Simplest scope** (single user, daily cadence, no real-time)
2. **Clearest value prop** ("Turn your day into proof of intention")
3. **Validates core pipeline** (Mark → Trace → Crystal) for ALL other pilots
4. **Fastest path to revenue** ($15/month consumer subscription)
5. **Mass market** (productivity/journaling is $B+ market)

## Critical Insights Synthesized (Revised)

### From Pilot Coherence Analysis

1. **Witness Pipeline is the Spine**: All 5 pilots converge on Mark → Trace → Crystal as non-negotiable infrastructure. This IS the steel thread.

2. **Joy Dimensions are Domain-Specific**: Productivity = FLOW, Consumer = WARMTH, Creative = SURPRISE. The joy loop must calibrate by domain.

3. **Pilots Test Different Galois Applications**: Build coherence (gaming), intent/delivery mismatch (coaching), style drift (generative), signal/noise (productivity).

4. **Pilot Laws Form a Grammar**: 25 laws across 5 pilots reduce to 5 schemas: Coherence Gate, Drift Alert, Ghost Preservation, Courage Preservation, Compression Honesty.

### From Zero Seed Audit

5. **Timeline/Scope Contradiction is Critical**: 8 weeks of detailed planning conflicts with scope across all documents. Fix: reduce Weeks 1-5 to pilot validation only.

6. **Galois "Novelty" Claim Needs Grounding**: The framework lacks rigorous comparison to existing semantic distance metrics. Conduct literature search before claiming publication.

7. **Constitutional Governance is Unvalidated**: None of the 5 pilots validate enterprise compliance. Defer this product until design partner commits.

8. **Layer Violations Exist**: Product strategy claims ($1M ARR) are L7 (representation) made at L3 (goal) confidence. Demote to speculative.

### From Analysis Operad Critique

9. **Roadmap Fails Generative Test**: Cannot be regenerated from pilots. Each week should validate infrastructure THROUGH a pilot, not in isolation.

10. **False Parallelism in Weeks 3+7**: Hidden dependencies exist (ingestion → axiom extraction; trust → joy sensing). Redraw dependency graph.

11. **Exit Criteria are Ungrounded**: "Kent validates 8/10" needs measurement protocol. Define operationally.

12. **No Go/No-Go Path Exists**: If Week 2 fails, what happens? Add explicit pivot path.

### From Product Analysis

13. **Consumer Before Enterprise**: 4/5 pilots are consumer-focused. Ship trail-to-crystal first, not Galois API.

14. **wasm-survivors is Orphaned**: No revenue path through current products. Demote to technical demo.

15. **Pricing Assumptions Untested**: $5K-50K/month enterprise pricing has zero validation. Add design partner gate.

## The Seven Constitutional Amendments

*Revised to include pilot-derived amendment*

### Amendment A: ETHICAL as Floor Constraint (Critical)

```python
def constitutional_score(action):
    ethical_score = score_ethical(action)

    if ethical_score < ETHICAL_FLOOR_THRESHOLD:  # 0.6
        return 0.0  # Immediate rejection

    weighted_sum = (
        composable_score * 1.5 +
        joy_score * 1.2 +
        tasteful_score * 1.0 +
        curated_score * 1.0 +
        heterarchical_score * 1.0 +
        generative_score * 1.0
    )
    return weighted_sum
```

### Amendment B: Unavailability Protocol

When Kent is unreachable for >24 hours:
1. No Level 4+ autonomous actions permitted
2. System operates in Conservative Mode (Level 2 max)
3. Decisions requiring veto are queued, not executed

### Amendment C: Trust Asymmetry

- Gained slowly: Each aligned decision adds trust at rate T
- Lost quickly: Each misaligned decision subtracts at rate 3T
- Decays: 10% per week without activity
- Per-capability: Tracked per action type, not globally

### Amendment D: Irreversible Action Gate

- **Reversible**: Full autonomy OK
- **Partially Reversible**: Confirmation for batch
- **Irreversible**: Always requires approval (publication, transactions, deletion)

### Amendment E: Privacy Sovereignty

1. Absolute right to delete all data
2. Source documents deleted after axiom extraction
3. Encrypted with user-controlled keys
4. No cross-user sharing without consent
5. Local-first always available

### Amendment F: Living Constitution

1. Reviewed every 180 days
2. Unused principles flagged
3. Historical decisions reference their version
4. Succession protocol for incapacitation

### Amendment G: Pilot Law Grammar (NEW)

All pilots derive laws from these 5 schemas:

| Schema | Pattern | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Coherence Gate** | X is valid only if Y is marked | "A run is valid only if every major build shift is marked" |
| **Drift Alert** | If loss > threshold, surface don't conceal | "If Galois loss exceeds threshold, surface the drift" |
| **Ghost Preservation** | Unchosen paths remain inspectable | "Unchosen upgrades recorded as ghost alternatives" |
| **Courage Preservation** | High-risk acts protected from penalty | "High-risk takes protected from negative weighting" |
| **Compression Honesty** | Crystal discloses what was dropped | "Crystal must reduce trace while preserving rationale" |

## The Consumer-First Product Path (Summary)

**Revised from enterprise-first to consumer-first based on pilot coverage**

| Month | Milestone | Revenue | Validation Source |
|-------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| 1-3 | trail-to-crystal MVP | $0 | Pilot ships |
| 3-6 | Zero Seed beta (100 users) | $1,500 MRR | User retention |
| 6-9 | Galois API launch | $5K MRR | Dev adoption |
| 9-12 | Consumer expansion | $20K MRR | trail + rap-coach |
| 12-18 | Enterprise pilot | $45K MRR | Design partner |
| 18 | Scale | $85K MRR (~$1M ARR) | Portfolio |

**Key Change**: Constitutional Governance Platform DEFERRED until enterprise design partner commits.

## The Joy Loop (Summary)

```
SENSE → MARK → TREND → ANALYZE → DETECT → DIVERGE → LEARN
```

**Domain-Specific Calibration**:
- **Productivity** (trail-to-crystal): FLOW primary — "lighter than a to-do list"
- **Consumer** (disney-portal): WARMTH primary — "planning feels like narrative design"
- **Creative** (rap-coach, sprite): SURPRISE primary — "discovery over QA"
- **Gaming** (wasm-survivors): FLOW primary — "witnessed without drag"

**Key principle**: Joy is inferred, not interrogated. Each pilot tests a different dimension.

**Full detail in [04-joy-integration.md](./04-joy-integration.md)**

## The Minimal Publishable Paper

**Title**: *"Galois Loss: Measuring Semantic Coherence via Restructure-Reconstitute Round-Trips"*

**CRITICAL**: Before claiming novelty, conduct literature search for:
- Round-trip semantic distance
- VAE reconstruction loss for semantics
- Lossy compression for coherence

**Timeline**: Literature search Week 1, draft by Week 4-5, arXiv preprint by Week 6.

**Venue targets**: ACT 2025, NeurIPS Workshops, EMNLP.

## Pivot Triggers

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| trail-to-crystal user retention | < 50% week-over-week | Revise value prop |
| Galois loss latency (fresh) | > 20s consistently | Re-architect LLM calls |
| Layer assignment accuracy | < 70% | Add human-in-the-loop |
| Consumer paid conversion | < 2% | Lower price or pivot |
| Enterprise interest by Month 9 | 0 leads | Deprioritize Constitutional |
| Kent's somatic response | Disgust | STOP. Veto is absolute. |

## The Mirror Test for This Plan

> *"Does this feel like Kent on his best day — or did we make it safe?"*

| Anchor | How This Plan Honors It |
|--------|-------------------------|
| *"Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy"* | Pilots are joy-first. trail-to-crystal is daring (productivity as proof). |
| *"The Mirror Test"* | Disgust veto preserved. Joy dimensions calibrated per domain. |
| *"Tasteful > feature-complete"* | 1 pilot ships Week 6, not 4 APIs with no validation. |
| *"The persona is a garden, not a museum"* | Constitution evolves via Amendment G (pilot law grammar). |
| *"Depth over breadth"* | trail-to-crystal validates pipeline deeply before expanding. |

## For Agent Orchestrators: Execution Instructions

### Phase 0: Verify Current State (Week 1)

```bash
# Core pipeline tests
cd impl/claude && uv run pytest services/witness/ -v

# Galois loss tests
cd impl/claude && uv run pytest services/zero_seed/galois/ -v

# Verify primitives exist
ls impl/claude/web/src/components/primitives/
```

### Phase 1: Build for Pilots (Weeks 2-5)

**Principle**: Every week validates infrastructure THROUGH a pilot, not in isolation.

| Week | Infrastructure | Pilot Context |
|------|----------------|---------------|
| 2 | Galois Loss API | wasm-survivors drift detection |
| 3 | ValueCompass | disney-portal tradeoffs |
| 4 | Trail primitive | rap-coach session navigation |
| 5 | Crystal compression | sprite-procedural style crystals |

### Phase 2: Ship First Pilot (Week 6)

**Exit Criteria for trail-to-crystal-daily-lab**:
- User can explain day using crystal + trail
- System surfaces one honest gap without shaming
- Day ends with shareable artifact

### Phase 3: Expand (Weeks 7-8)

Complete 2 more pilots. Demo to stakeholders.

## Grounding Statement

This plan has been audited using:
- **Analysis Operad** (4-mode critique: Categorical 0.65, Epistemic 0.55, Dialectical 0.70, Generative 0.40)
- **Zero Seed Protocol** (Galois loss on documents: composite 0.44, moderate coherence)
- **Pilot Coherence Analysis** (5 proto-specs → shared patterns)

The result: a pilot-first, consumer-first, joy-calibrated execution path that validates the Witness Pipeline before scaling to enterprise.

> *"The proof IS the decision. The mark IS the witness. The pilot IS the validation."*

Let's ship trail-to-crystal.
