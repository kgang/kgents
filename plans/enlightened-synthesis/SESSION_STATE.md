# Session State: Enlightened Synthesis

> *"The proof IS the decision. The mark IS the witness."*

**Status**: ACTIVE EXECUTION
**Infrastructure**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Pilots Validated**: trail-to-crystal (2 generations)

## Current Progress

### What's Complete

| Component | Evidence |
|-----------|----------|
| **All 7 Amendments (A-G)** | Implemented and tested |
| **K-Block ↔ Witness Bridge** | 97 tests, bidirectional lineage |
| **Daily Lab Orchestrator** | 1,432 lines, all contracts |
| **Crystal Honesty Module** | WARMTH-calibrated, 27 tests |
| **JoyPoly Functor** | Categorical composition, 37 tests |
| **Performance Benchmarks** | CI workflow, all SLAs exceeded |
| **Witnessed Regeneration Protocol** | 5-stage pipeline proven |

### Test Coverage

- **~1,700 tests passing** total
- Performance exceeds SLAs by 10,000-16,000,000x

### Key Insights Crystallized

1. **Joy composition requires associative operations** — Use `max(a, b)` not weighted average
2. **WARMTH disclosures avoid "loss" language** — Use "compressed," "condensed," "resting"
3. **Protocol pattern prevents circular imports** — Define in K-Block, implement in Witness
4. **Bridge failures must not break K-Block** — Wrap in try/except, fail gracefully
5. **Galois Loss is novel application, not novel formula** — Frame as "categorical layer assignment"

## Pilots Status

| Pilot | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| trail-to-crystal-daily-lab | ✅ VALIDATED | 2 generations via witnessed-regeneration |
| zero-seed-personal-governance-lab | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | Being executed by separate agent |
| wasm-survivors-game | READY | Validates Galois drift detection |

## Active Execution

### Remaining Work

1. **Generate remaining pilots** via witnessed-regeneration
2. **Extract categorical-foundation** as standalone packages
3. **Product readiness** — Galois API, consumer launch

### Sub-Agent Orchestration

Each pilot uses the 5-stage witnessed-regeneration pipeline:
```
Archive → Verify → Generate → Validate → Learn
```

Required context for each agent:
- `pilots/{pilot-name}/PROTO_SPEC.md`
- `spec/protocols/witnessed-regeneration.md`
- `docs/skills/witnessed-regeneration.md`

## The Mantra

```
The day is the proof.
Honest gaps are signal.
Compression is memory.
Joy composes.
The mark IS the witness.
Generation is decision.
```
