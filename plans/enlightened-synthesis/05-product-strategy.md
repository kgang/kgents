# Product Strategy: Consumer-First Path to $1M ARR

> *"kgents is a cathedral. The market wants drive-throughs. But cathedrals outlast drive-throughs."*

**Created**: 2025-12-25
**Revised**: 2025-12-26 (Consumer-First Resequencing Based on Pilots)
**Status**: Go-to-Market Strategy
**Purpose**: Ship products that survive long enough for the market to catch up

---

## Critical Update: Consumer Before Enterprise

**Based on pilot analysis**: 4/5 pilots are consumer-focused. The enterprise strategy (Constitutional Governance Platform) has ZERO pilot validation. The product sequence has been reordered.

### Pilot Validation Matrix

| Product | Validating Pilots | Validation Confidence |
|---------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Zero Seed Consumer | trail-to-crystal, rap-coach, sprite-taste | HIGH (3 pilots) |
| Galois API | rap-coach, sprite-taste, wasm-survivors | MEDIUM (3 pilots) |
| Witnessed Agents API | ALL 5 | HIGH (infrastructure validated) |
| Constitutional Governance | NONE | **UNVALIDATED** |

**Key Change**: Constitutional Governance Platform is DEFERRED until an enterprise design partner commits.

---

## The Strategic Bet (Unchanged, But Resequenced)

**While the market races toward capability, kgents races toward trust.**

This is contrarian. The market is spending billions on faster, smarter, more capable agents. Nobody is building trust infrastructure.

**Why this bet might work**:
- 80% of enterprises report risky agent behavior (BCG 2025)
- EU AI Act Article 19 mandates audit trails with penalties
- The first major AI agent scandal will create overnight demand
- Compliance is a budgeted cost center; trust is not (yet)

**Why this bet might fail**:
- Trust is invisible until failure; capability is visible daily
- Enterprise sales cycles are long (6-12 months)
- If Anthropic/OpenAI ship trust features, the moat evaporates
- "Trust infrastructure" doesn't trigger purchase intent

**NEW: Why Consumer-First Mitigates Risk**:
- Consumer validates infrastructure with faster feedback loops
- Consumer traction creates enterprise inbound
- Consumer pricing ($15/mo) is validated by productivity market (Day One, Notion)
- Enterprise can be added AFTER consumer proves value

---

## The Four Products (RESEQUENCED)

### Product 1: Zero Seed Consumer (FIRST TO SHIP)

**What**: Personal epistemology platform via witnessed daily workflow.

**For**: Knowledge workers who want to understand their own thinking.

**Wedge Pilot**: **trail-to-crystal-daily-lab** (ships Week 6)

**Value**: "Turn your day into proof of intention. See who you actually are."

**Pricing**:
- Free: 10 days history, basic coherence
- Premium: $15/month (unlimited, crystals, axiom extraction)
- Team: $49/month per seat

**Timeline**: Month 1-3 (via trail-to-crystal pilot)

**Canary Success Criteria** (from proto-spec):
1. User can explain day using crystal + trail
2. System surfaces one honest gap without shaming
3. Day ends with shareable artifact

**10x Moment**: "I saw my actual priorities crystallized. It explained why I kept feeling behind—I wasn't working on what I thought I valued."

---

### Product 2: Galois Coherence API

**What**: Semantic coherence measurement as a service.

**For**: Developers building knowledge management, RAG, document processing.

**Validating Pilots**: rap-coach (intent/delivery mismatch), sprite-procedural (style drift), wasm-survivors (build coherence)

**Value**: "Find contradictions in your knowledge base instantly."

**Pricing**:
- Free: 1,000 computations/month
- Pro: $49/month (50,000 computations) + $0.002/additional
- Enterprise: Custom

**Timeline**: Month 3-6 (after Zero Seed validates pipeline)

**10x Moment**: "I uploaded our company wiki and found 47 contradictions nobody knew about."

---

### Product 3: Witnessed Agents API

**What**: Trust infrastructure for agent workflows.

**For**: Enterprises deploying AI agents in production.

**Validating Pilots**: ALL 5 (this is the infrastructure layer)

**Value**: "Every agent decision has a witness. Every workflow has a trace."

**Pricing**:
- Starter: $199/month (500,000 marks)
- Team: $999/month (5M marks)
- Enterprise: $5,000+/month (unlimited)

**Timeline**: Month 6-10

**10x Moment**: "When the agent made a mistake, I replayed the decision and saw exactly why. Fixed it in 10 minutes instead of 10 hours."

---

### Product 4: Constitutional Governance Platform (DEFERRED)

**What**: Enterprise governance for AI agent fleets.

**For**: Regulated industries deploying AI at scale.

**Validating Pilots**: NONE (this product needs an enterprise pilot)

**Value**: "EU AI Act compliance out of the box. Every agent action is witnessed, scored, and auditable."

**Pricing**:
- Mid-market: $5,000/month
- Enterprise: $50,000+/year

**Timeline**: Month 12-24 (DEFERRED until design partner commits)

**Gates Before Commitment**:
- [ ] 1 enterprise design partner signed
- [ ] 1 compliance pilot (fintech or healthcare) completed
- [ ] Pricing validated ($5K/month assumption tested)

**10x Moment**: "We passed our first AI audit in 48 hours because every decision had a witness mark and constitutional score."

## Revised Revenue Model

### Path to $5K MRR (Fastest)

| Week | Action | Revenue |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1-6 | Build trail-to-crystal pilot | $0 |
| 7-8 | Private beta with 50 productivity enthusiasts | $0 |
| 9-12 | Public launch with $15/mo paywall | Target: 100 users |
| 12 | **$1,500 MRR** | |
| 13-16 | Content marketing (productivity podcasts, newsletters) | |
| 16 | **$5K MRR** (333 users @ $15/mo) | |

### Path to $1M ARR

**Revised Model** (consumer-first, enterprise-deferred):

| Month | Zero Seed | Galois API | Witnessed Agents | Enterprise | Total MRR |
|-------|-----------|------------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| 3 | $0 (beta) | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| 6 | $3K (200 @ $15) | $2K (40 Pro) | $0 | $0 | $5K |
| 9 | $10K (700) | $5K (100 Pro) | $2K (10 Starter) | $0 | $17K |
| 12 | $20K (1,300) | $10K (200 Pro) | $10K (mixed) | $5K (1 pilot) | $45K |
| 18 | $35K (2,300) | $20K (400 Pro) | $20K | $15K (3 ent) | $90K |

**$90K MRR = ~$1M ARR by Month 18**

**Note**: This model is more conservative than the original because:
1. Enterprise Constitutional Governance is deferred
2. Consumer traction must prove before enterprise investment
3. Galois API Pro adoption depends on Zero Seed success

---

## The GTM Sequence (REVISED: Consumer-First)

### Phase 1: Consumer Wedge via trail-to-crystal (Month 1-4)

**Strategy**: Ship trail-to-crystal pilot as Zero Seed MVP. Get productivity enthusiasts using daily.

**Why first** (revised from developer-first):
- 3 pilots validate this product (highest confidence)
- Fastest feedback loop (daily retention signal)
- Consumer pricing is validated (Day One, Notion market)
- Creates word-of-mouth + shareable artifacts

**Tactics**:
1. Private beta with 50 productivity enthusiasts (Month 2)
2. Content marketing: productivity podcasts, newsletters (Month 3)
3. Public launch with $15/mo paywall (Month 4)
4. Create "crystal your day" social proof artifacts

**Milestones**:
- Month 2: 50 beta users
- Month 3: 100 active users
- Month 4: 200+ users, $1.5K MRR

---

### Phase 2: Developer via Galois API (Month 3-6)

**Strategy**: Ship Galois API in parallel, using Zero Seed infrastructure.

**Why now**:
- Consumer infrastructure is validated
- rap-coach and sprite-procedural prove Galois applications

4. Build integrations (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Notion)

**Milestones**:
- Month 4: 100 developer users
- Month 6: 500 MAU, $5K MRR

---

### Phase 3: Enterprise Expansion (Month 6-12)

**Strategy**: Convert consumer + developer interest into enterprise deals.

**Why now**:
- Consumer traction proves value
- Developers are internal champions
- Witness API is ready for pilot

**Tactics**:
1. Identify 10 design partners (warm intros from developers)
2. Offer free pilot in exchange for case study
3. Focus on compliance-driven industries (fintech, healthcare)
4. Hire first enterprise sales rep

**Milestones**:
- Month 8: 3 design partners
- Month 10: 1 paying enterprise customer
- Month 12: 3 paying customers, $30K MRR

---

### Phase 3: Product Expansion (Month 12-18)

**Strategy**: Launch consumer product, scale enterprise.

**Why now**:
- Enterprise validates willingness to pay
- Consumer builds brand story
- Academic paper creates credibility halo

**Tactics**:
1. Launch Zero Seed Consumer (waitlist → beta → public)
2. Create content marketing (blog, newsletter, talks)
3. Expand enterprise sales team
4. Consider B2B2C (sell to coaches who bring clients)

**Milestones**:
- Month 14: 500 consumer beta users
- Month 16: 100 paying consumer users
- Month 18: 10 enterprise customers, $100K MRR

---

## Pricing Philosophy

### Cost-Plus vs. Value-Based

**Cost-plus** (our costs + margin):
- Galois computation: ~$0.01/call (LLM + compute)
- Witness mark: ~$0.0001/mark (storage + indexing)

**Value-based** (what it's worth to customer):
- Finding a major contradiction: Prevents hours of debugging
- EU AI Act compliance: Prevents 6-figure fines
- Personal insight: Priceless (but willingness to pay is limited)

**Our approach**: Value-based for enterprises, cost-plus for developers.

| Product | Pricing Model | Rationale |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Galois API | Cost-plus | Low barrier, volume play |
| Witnessed Agents | Value-based | Compliance has high value |
| Zero Seed Consumer | Subscription | Relationship, not transaction |
| Governance Platform | Value-based | Audit prevention is worth $$$$ |

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Direct Competitors

**None building trust infrastructure explicitly.**

### Adjacent Competitors

| Competitor | Threat Level | Our Advantage |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Langfuse** | HIGH | They have observability; we have provenance |
| **Galileo** | MEDIUM | They have guardrails; we have principles |
| **IBM watsonx.gov** | HIGH | They have enterprise sales; we have novel theory |
| **Weights & Biases** | LOW | They focus on ML; we focus on agents |
| **Datadog** | LOW | They do infra; we do decisions |

### The Moat

1. **Galois Loss is novel** — If we publish first, we own the concept
2. **Constitutional framework is opinionated** — Big cos won't ship "disgust veto"
3. **Kent's taste cannot be replicated** — "Garden not museum" is not a feature

### The Vulnerability

**If Anthropic ships trust features natively**:
- Likely: Lightweight tracing (they already have this)
- Unlikely: Constitutional governance (too opinionated)
- Possible: Acqui-hire if we prove the market

## Revenue Model

### Path to $1M ARR

| Milestone | Timeline | Revenue | Customers |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Galois API alpha | Month 2 | $0 | 100 beta |
| Galois API launch | Month 4 | $5K MRR | 50 Pro, 5 Enterprise |
| Witnessed Agents beta | Month 6 | $15K MRR | 10 design partners |
| Zero Seed early access | Month 10 | $30K MRR | 100 consumer, 3 enterprise |
| Enterprise scale | Month 14 | $60K MRR | 10 enterprise |
| $1M ARR | Month 18 | $83K MRR | 15 enterprise, 500 consumer |

### The Math

**Option A: Enterprise-focused**
- 17 customers × $5K/month = $85K MRR ≈ $1M ARR
- Pro: Higher ARPU, stickier customers
- Con: Long sales cycles, requires sales team

**Option B: Consumer-focused**
- 5,500 users × $15/month = $82.5K MRR ≈ $1M ARR
- Pro: Self-serve, viral potential
- Con: High churn, low willingness to pay

**Option C: Hybrid (recommended)**
- 10 enterprise × $5K = $50K MRR
- 200 consumer × $15 = $3K MRR
- 2,000 Pro API × $49 = $30K MRR
- Total: $83K MRR ≈ $1M ARR

**Message**: "Galois Coherence API finds semantic contradictions in your knowledge base before your users do."

**Proof**: "47 contradictions found in 30 seconds. Try free."

### For Enterprises

**Pain**: "We can't deploy AI agents without audit trails"

**Message**: "Every agent decision witnessed. EU AI Act compliant. Replay any decision instantly."

**Proof**: "Reduced incident investigation from 10 hours to 10 minutes."

### For Consumers

**Pain**: "I don't understand why I keep making the same mistakes"

**Message**: "Discover the values you actually hold — not who you think you are."

**Proof**: "I extracted axioms from 5 years of journals. Here's what I learned about myself."

## Risks and Mitigations

### Market Risk: "Trust isn't a buying trigger"

**Mitigation**: Reframe as "compliance" — a budgeted cost center.

### Technology Risk: "Galois Loss doesn't generalize"

**Mitigation**: Extensive beta testing before public launch.

### Competitive Risk: "Anthropic ships trust features"

**Mitigation**: Publish first, build relationships, be opinionated.

### Execution Risk: "Can't ship fast enough"

**Mitigation**: Steel Thread validates core thesis in Week 2-3.

### Sales Risk: "No enterprise sales capability"

**Mitigation**: Self-serve for developers, hire sales at Month 6.

---

## The Mirror Test for This Strategy

> *"Does this strategy feel like Kent on his best day?"*

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Is it daring? | Yes — "Trust over capability" is contrarian |
| Is it bold? | Yes — Building a cathedral, not a drive-through |
| Is it creative? | Yes — Galois Loss is genuinely novel |
| Is it opinionated? | Yes — "Witnessed AI" is a stance |
| Is it gaudy? | No — 4 products, not 40 features |

**The uncomfortable truth this strategy acknowledges**:

kgents is a cathedral in a market that wants drive-throughs.

The question isn't whether the vision is right. It's whether Kent can survive long enough for the market to catch up.

The path forward is narrow: **ship fast, publish first, define the category before IBM does.**
