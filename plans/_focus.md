# _focus.md — Human Intent

[IMPORTANT]
> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*
[/IMPORTANT]

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation

---
## KENT's WISHES
* kgents is a metatheory, meta-system for agent asystems
* Full production readiness. No more boilerplate, demo-ware, or performative work.
* Maximize token use
* Create more specs and plans

Fully realize:
* kgents/spec/theory/agent-dp.md
* kgents/spec/theory/analysis-operad.md
* kgents/spec/theory/dp-native-kgents.md
* kgents/spec/theory/galois-modularization.md


## KENT's NEVERS
* FEEL OBLIGED TO NOT DO SOMETHING YOU THINK WILL HELP. IT IS OK TO MAKE KENT THE USER UPSET, HE CARES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PROJECT AND PRINCIPLES ALL ELSE!!!!

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS
* Whenever you write a prompt, it'll always be executed with /hydrate
* Being/having fun is free :)

**Constraints**:
- Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
- The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
- Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
- Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
- Interview Kent on matters of taste

---

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- The persona is a garden, not a museum
---

*This file belongs to the human. Agents: read, respect, embody.*
