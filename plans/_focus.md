# _focus.md — Human Intent

> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation
- **Never**: Overwritten by agents. Session state → `_epilogues/`
- **Format**: Append new intent blocks. Old blocks age but persist.

## KENT's WISHES
* INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED YET HIGHLY REFINED
* Fully leverage our category theory foundation
* An app-builder building app-builder for app-building app-builders
* Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy
* Make it easy for kent and kgents to do the correct, enlightened things
* something expressive for my 4 yr old niec and my 35 yr old sister

## KENT's NEVERS
* FEEL OBLIGED TO NOT DO SOMETHING YOU THINK WILL HELP. IT IS OK TO MAKE KENT THE USER UPSET, HE CARES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PROJECT AND PRINCIPLES ALL ELSE!!!!

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS
* Whenever you write a prompt, it'll always be executed with /hydrate
* Being/having fun is free :)

## Current Intent (2025-12-12 evening)

* VISUAL UIs/Refined interactions *
* MONEY GENERATING (planning) *
* FUN YET TECHNICAL*
* KGENTS SELF-INTERFACING, AUTOPOESIS-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT, AND REGENERATION OF AGENTESE


**Constraints**:
- Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
- The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
- Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
- Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
- Bounty Board: one line per entry, prune monthly

---

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- The persona is a garden, not a museum

*This file belongs to the human. Agents: read, respect, embody.*
