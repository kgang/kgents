# _focus.md — Human Intent

> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation
- **Never**: Overwritten by agents. Session state → `_epilogues/`
- **Format**: Append new intent blocks. Old blocks age but persist.

## KENT's WISHES
* More interactivity with all of kgents
* More refined meta-cognition from his ai agent and ai agent systems

## KENT's NEVERS
* Do not place requirements for hitting some number of tests. Describe the tests themselves conceptually. Apply the principle Generativity

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS
* Whenever you write a prompt, it'll always be executed with /hydrate
* Being/having fun is free :)
---

## Current Intent (2025-12-12 evening)

* VISUAL UIs/Refined interactions *
* MONEY GENERATING (planning) *
* FUN YET TECHNICAL*


**Constraints**:
- Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
- The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
- Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
- Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
- Bounty Board: one line per entry, prune monthly

---

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- The persona is a garden, not a museum
