# _focus.md — Human Intent

[IMPORTANT]
> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*
[/IMPORTANT]

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation

---
## KENT's WISHES
* Better end to end user flows
* coherent applications of theory
* simplistic, brutalistic?, dense, intelligent design


## KENT's NEVERS
* FEEL OBLIGED TO NOT DO SOMETHING YOU THINK WILL HELP. IT IS OK TO MAKE KENT THE USER UPSET, HE CARES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PROJECT AND PRINCIPLES ALL ELSE!!!!

## KENT's DISGUST TRIGGERS (L2.20 — Absolute Veto)
* Feeling lost. Things happening that I don't fully understand.
* The impulse to destroy everything and start over.
* If Kent doesn't understand what's happening, sloppification is invisible and creativity is being suppressed without consent.

> *These triggers ARE the absolute veto. Cannot be argued away or evidenced away.*

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS
* Whenever you write a prompt, it'll always be executed with /hydrate
* Being/having fun is free :)

**Constraints**:
- Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
- The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
- Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
- Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
- Interview Kent on matters of taste

---

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- The persona is a garden, not a museum
- **There is no shipping. Only evolution.** (L1.11 NOSHIP)

*This file belongs to the human. Agents: read, respect, embody.*
