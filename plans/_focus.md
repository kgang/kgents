# _focus.md — Human Intent

> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation
- **Never**: Overwritten by agents. Session state → `_epilogues/`
- **Format**: Append new intent blocks. Old blocks age but persist.

## KENT's WISHES
* COMPOSITIONAL GENERATIVE UI
* LLMAgents using haiku tokens liberally in agent town, running on our cluster
* Create a shockingly delightful consumer, prosumer, and professional experience
* Builder Workshop
* "holographic metaphor reification"
* Agent Town's builders:
  - Chefs in a kitchen (expertise, collaboration, mise en place)
  - Gardeners in a garden (cultivation, patience, seasonality)
  - Kids on a playground (play, exploration, joy)


```original_prompt
Let's REALLY go hard with Agent Town (bigger, emergent), in fact i'll update focus now.
I want to expand the scope of this 4x. This should be one of the soul converging points for this project.
This is really where I didn't know where I wanted to go.

CRITICAL REFERENCES: ENSHRINE IN SPECS!!!!
THERE ARE VERY IMPORTANT CONCEPTUAL REFERENCE "HERITAGE" FOR KENT: DIRECT INSPIRATIONS FOR ALL HIS WORK ON
KGENTS AND MANY YEARS LEADING UP TO IT
* https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07924 `CHATDEV`
* https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442 `SIMULACRA`
* https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00114 `ALTERA`

Note: extend all of the above with polyfunctor category theory to include system orchestration,
proprioception, modifying self-deployment, iterative-emergent complex adaptive system behavior dynamices
etc.

CREATE THE GRANDEST strategy of many, many agents, bootstrapped through this system to ultimately become a
west world like simulation park with infinite dimension detail on people (if they pay infinite amounts of
money). The core concept is this holographic metaphor reification (see spec/psi-gents, AGENTESE, and
umwelt).

Combine ALL plans, specs, and work so far, along with the papers above, and especially close readings of
plans/principles and spec/principles to lay out YOUR GRAND META-NARRATIVE so everything is re-written,
re-formulate, re-imagined, and transformed to serve these ideas.
```

## KENT's NEVERS
* Do not place requirements for hitting some number of tests. Describe the tests themselves conceptually. Apply the principle Generativity

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS
* Whenever you write a prompt, it'll always be executed with /hydrate
* Being/having fun is free :)

## Current Intent (2025-12-12 evening)

* VISUAL UIs/Refined interactions *
* MONEY GENERATING (planning) *
* FUN YET TECHNICAL*


**Constraints**:
- Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
- The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
- Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
- Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
- Bounty Board: one line per entry, prune monthly

---

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- The persona is a garden, not a museum

*This file belongs to the human. Agents: read, respect, embody.*
