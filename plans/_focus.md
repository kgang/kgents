# _focus.md — Human Intent

> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation
- **Never**: Overwritten by agents. Session state → `_epilogues/`
- **Format**: Append new intent blocks. Old blocks age but persist.

## KENT's WISHES
* More interactivity with all of kgents
* More refined meta-cognition from his ai agent and ai agent systems

## KENT's NEVERS
* Do not place requirements for hitting some number of tests. Describe the tests themselves conceptually. Apply the principle Generativity

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS
* Whenever you write a prompt, it'll always be executed with /hydrate
* Being/having fun is free :)

## Current Intent (2025-12-12)

**Primary (60%)**: `concept/lattice` — Wire to `concept.*.define`. Genealogy is foundational.

**Secondary (25%)**: `concept/creativity` — Tasks 2-4 are polish, not urgent.

**Accursed (5%)**: Flux archetype integration — How do Consolidator, Spawner, Witness instantiate?

**Constraints**:
- No new plans until Lattice wiring complete
- Prefer depth over breadth this week
- Meta files must stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)

---

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- 8,714+ tests is a floor, not a ceiling

## Archived Intent

<details>
<summary>2025-12-11</summary>

**Focus**: Flux Functor implementation
**Outcome**: Complete (261 tests). Living Pipelines work.
**Learning**: Event-driven > timer-driven. Perturbation > bypass.

<summary>2025-12-10</summary>

**Focus**: I-gent v2.5, Reflector Pattern
**Outcome**: Phases 1-5 complete (137 tests). FluxReflector bridges CLI↔TUI.
**Learning**: Textual reactive model maps cleanly to density fields.

*This file belongs to the human. Agents: read, respect, respond—but never rewrite.*
