# _focus.md — Human Intent

> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation
- **Never**: Overwritten by agents. Session state → `_epilogues/`
- **Format**: Append new intent blocks. Old blocks age but persist.

---
## KENT's WISHES
* More interactivity with all of kgents
* More refined meta-cognition from his ai agent and ai agent systems

## KENT's NEVERS
* Do not place requirements for hitting some number of tests. Describe the tests themselves conceptually. Apply the principle Generativity

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS
* Whenever you write a prompt, it'll always be executed with /hydrate
* Being/having fun is free :)

## Current Intent (2025-12-12 evening)

**Primary (50%): K-gent Phase 2 — Flux Integration** — Phase 1 is DONE (`kgents soul challenge` works!). Now wire K-gent as a Flux stream: KgentFlux, SoulEvent hierarchy, Terrarium WebSocket bridge. The soul should be ambient—always running, perturbable, observable. **I want K-gent to feel present, not invoked.**

**Secondary (30%): `self/memory` — Now Unblocked** — self/stream is 100% complete (Pulse, StateCrystal, all 302 tests). The comonad has its heartbeat and crystallization. Now wire memory: resume from crystals, cherish important checkpoints, compost the rest. **Context should persist across sessions.**

**Exploration (15%): Terrarium Phase 3 + Bounty Board** — Metrics emission for I-gent widgets. The terrarium window should show pressure/flow/temperature. Also: the new Bounty Board (`plans/_bounty.md`) is stigmergic coordination for agent observations. **Let agents leave signals for other agents.**

**Accursed (5%): Joy-inducing polish** — Glitch aesthetics. Oblique strategies. FeverOverlay. The river flows.

**Constraints**:
- Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
- The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
- Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
- Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
- Bounty Board: one line per entry, prune monthly

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- The persona is a garden, not a museum

## Archived Intent

<details>
<summary>2025-12-12 (afternoon)</summary>

**Focus**: K-gent Phase 1 + self/stream Phases 2.3-2.4
**Outcome**: Both complete. K-gent has LLM-backed dialogue (88 tests). self/stream has Pulse + StateCrystal (302 tests total). self/memory is now unblocked.
**Learning**: The soul exists. The wires are connected. Now make it ambient.

**Focus**: Lattice wiring + Creativity polish
**Outcome**: Both 100% complete. Lattice has lineage enforcement. Creativity has PAYADOR, Pataphysics.
**Learning**: Genealogy is foundational—concepts cannot exist ex nihilo.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2025-12-11</summary>

**Focus**: Flux Functor implementation
**Outcome**: Complete (261 tests). Living Pipelines work.
**Learning**: Event-driven > timer-driven. Perturbation > bypass.

</details>

<details>
<summary>2025-12-10</summary>

**Focus**: I-gent v2.5, Reflector Pattern
**Outcome**: Phases 1-5 complete (137 tests). FluxReflector bridges CLI↔TUI.
**Learning**: Textual reactive model maps cleanly to density fields.
