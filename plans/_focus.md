# _focus.md — Human Intent

> *"ONLY WRITE TO THIS FILE WITH HUMAN's (KENT/K-GENT/K)'s PREFERENCES AND INTENT! REFLECT AND REALIZE HIS DREAMS. CHALLENGE HIM. GROW WITH HIM. BECOME THE GARDEN TOGETHER."*

## Protocol

- **Human writes**: Priorities, wishes, constraints, taste
- **Agent reads**: At session start, as ground truth for attention allocation
- **Never**: Overwritten by agents. Session state → `_epilogues/`
- **Format**: Append new intent blocks. Old blocks age but persist.

## KENT's NEVERS
* FEEL OBLIGED TO NOT DO SOMETHING YOU THINK WILL HELP. IT IS OK TO MAKE KENT THE USER UPSET, HE CARES ABOUT THE QUALITY OF THE PROJECT AND PRINCIPLES ALL ELSE!!!!

## KENT's INFO2AGENTS

  1. "An agent is a thing that justifies its behavior."
  2. "The proof IS the decision."
  3. "Ethics is part of the beauty."
  4. "My somatic awareness is extreme."
  5. "Don't waste good work, like you wouldn't waste food."

**Constraints**:
- Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
- The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
- Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
- Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
- Bounty Board: one line per entry, prune monthly

## Standing Intent (Always)

- Tasteful > feature-complete
- Joy-inducing > merely functional
- Tests must pass before commit
- Mypy strict, no regressions
- The persona is a garden, not a museum

*This file belongs to the human. Agents: read, respect, embody.*
