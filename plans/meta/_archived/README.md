# Archived Planning Documents

These documents were archived on 2025-12-14 during the re-metabolization that produced `unified-engine-master-prompt.md`.

## Why Archived

| Document | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| `chromatic-engine-master-prompt.md` | Metaphor exploration. Insights distilled into unified prompt. |
| `chromatic-engine-design.md` | Design exploration. Scene-graph metaphor was describing existing infra. |
| `nphase-do-deep-integration.md` | Integration plan. Superseded by simpler unified approach. |
| `nphase-prompt-compiler-research.md` | RESEARCH phase. Compiler is now IMPLEMENTED. |
| `nphase-prompt-compiler-develop.md` | DEVELOP phase. Compiler is now IMPLEMENTED. |
| `nphase-do-integration.md` | Stale plan. Superseded by unified-engine-master-prompt.md. |

## Key Insights Preserved

The chromatic/scene-graph metaphor taught us:
1. N-Phase stages ARE like render passes (associative, lawful)
2. AGENTESE umwelt already provides "shader-like" observer-dependent behavior
3. Entropy budget IS like GPU budget (resource constraint per phase)
4. Turn-gent governance IS like blend modes (approve/reject dialectic)

These insights now live in the unified prompt and the implementation itself.
