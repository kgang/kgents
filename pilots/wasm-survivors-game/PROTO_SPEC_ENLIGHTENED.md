# PROTO_SPEC: Enlightened Edition

> *"The game that knows you better than you know yourself."*

This document proposes transformative changes to PROTO_SPEC that would push toward a genuinely market-killing survivors-like.

---

## The Core Insight: The Name is a Lie

The game is called **"Witnessed Run Lab"** but witnessing is *passive*—it records without responding. The witness sees but doesn't speak.

**The enlightened version**: The witness is *active*. It learns. It adapts. It knows you.

This transforms the game from "survivors-like with good death screen" to "the game that teaches you about yourself."

---

## Proposed Additions

### 1. ADAPTIVE WITNESS (New Core Pillar)

> *"The arena learns your patterns and responds. You're not playing against the game—you're playing against yourself."*

**The Concept**: The game builds a model of YOUR playstyle and uses it.

**Mechanics**:

| Feature | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pattern Recognition** | Game tracks your dodge directions, positioning preferences, build choices | Creates personal relationship |
| **Personalized Death Attribution** | "You always dodge left—they caught you on the right" | Learning feels targeted |
| **Adaptive Difficulty** | Enemies telegraph LONGER for patterns you struggle with, SHORTER for mastered ones | Difficulty is personal, not global |
| **Style Fingerprinting** | Categorizes playstyle: "Aggressive Orbiter", "Careful Farmer", "Glass Cannon" | Creates identity |
| **Mirror Enemies** | Occasional enemy that moves like YOU (based on your patterns) | Fight yourself |

**Implementation Laws**:
- **W1 Invisible Learning**: Player never sees the model being built. No HUD, no notifications.
- **W2 Subtle Response**: Adaptations are felt, not announced. "This feels harder" not "Difficulty increased."
- **W3 Fair Adaptation**: Never punishes mastery. Adapts to weaknesses, not strengths.
- **W4 Style Persistence**: Your style profile persists across sessions. The game remembers you.

**Why This is Exceptional**: No survivors-like does this. Games are static—same enemies, same patterns, same arena. An adaptive witness makes every player's experience unique to *them*.

### 2. CRYSTAL INHERITANCE (New Meta-Mechanic)

> *"Your deaths aren't endings—they're seeds. Plant them."*

**The Concept**: Crystals aren't just trophies. They're genetic material for future runs.

**Mechanics**:

| Feature | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Crystal Planting** | Start a new run with any previous crystal's first upgrade | Strategic meta-layer |
| **Lineage Tracking** | Each run shows its ancestry: "Child of Run 47, grandchild of Run 12" | Narrative emerges |
| **Mutation** | Inherited builds can evolve differently than their parent | Discovery persists |
| **Community Inheritance** | Other players can inherit YOUR crystals via share | Social layer |
| **Crystal Fusion** | Combine two crystals to create hybrid starting conditions | Deep meta-strategy |

**The Key Insight**: This is NOT power progression. Starting with an upgrade doesn't make you stronger—it makes your run *different*. A "Tank lineage" and "Glass Cannon lineage" are equally valid, just distinct.

**Implementation Laws**:
- **I1 No Power Creep**: Inherited upgrades are starting points, not advantages. Wave 1 difficulty is the same.
- **I2 Lineage Visibility**: Your crystal shows its full ancestry. See how your playstyle evolved.
- **I3 Community Crystals**: Anyone can inherit any shared crystal. Your death becomes someone else's start.
- **I4 Extinction Possible**: If a lineage produces no inheritors, it ends. Natural selection of builds.

**Why This is Exceptional**: This creates a **personal meta-narrative** without the treadmill of unlocks. You're not grinding power—you're exploring possibility space. And your deaths MATTER because they become seeds.

---

### 3. ARENA MEMORY (New Environmental System)

> *"The arena remembers. Every death leaves a mark. Your geography is personal."*

**The Concept**: The arena is not a static space. It accumulates the ghosts of your past runs.

**Mechanics**:

| Feature | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Death Echoes** | Faint ghostly marks where YOU died in past runs | Personal geography |
| **Danger Heatmap** | Subtle color shift in areas where you die often | Subconscious learning |
| **Ghost Whispers** | Hovering near a death echo shows: "Run 34: Killed by Rusher charge" | History present |
| **Avoidance Learning** | Your movement patterns avoid your death spots over time | Embodied memory |
| **Redemption Markers** | Survive 30s in a spot where you've died 5+ times = permanent marker | Achievement geography |

**Implementation Laws**:
- **A1 Subtle Presence**: Death echoes are barely visible. You feel them more than see them.
- **A2 Personal Only**: You only see YOUR death geography. Others have their own.
- **A3 Fading Memory**: Very old deaths fade. Recent deaths are more visible.
- **A4 No Exploitation**: Death echoes don't affect enemies. They're information, not advantage.

**Why This is Exceptional**: This makes the arena *yours*. After 100 runs, you have a personal relationship with the space. "That corner killed me in run 12, run 34, and run 67—I never go there now."

### 4. RITUAL DEATH (Transform the Death Experience)

> *"Death is not game over. Death is the moment of choice."*

**The Concept**: The current death screen is excellent for information. But it's passive. What if death was *interactive*?

**Mechanics**:

| Feature | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Legacy Selection** | At death, choose ONE thing to strengthen for your next run | Death = agency |
| **Sacrifice Mechanic** | Give up one inherited trait to double another | Meaningful trade-offs |
| **Last Words** | Write a short note to your next run's self | Narrative continuity |
| **Crystal Shaping** | Influence what your crystal contains before it crystallizes | Control your legacy |
| **Blessing/Curse** | Choose: bless next run (easier wave 1) OR curse next run (harder, better crystal) | Risk/reward at death |

**The Experience**:
1. You die
2. Crystallization overlay shows (the fracture lines, the golden accents)
3. During crystallization, UI elements appear: "What do you preserve?"
4. You make choices (5-10 seconds)
5. Crystal solidifies with your choices embedded
6. Death screen shows with your legacy visible

**Implementation Laws**:
- **R1 Quick Ritual**: Total death experience < 15 seconds including choices
- **R2 Skip Option**: Hold SPACE to skip ritual and accept defaults
- **R3 Meaningful Choices**: Every ritual choice should change your next run noticeably
- **R4 No Wrong Answers**: All ritual paths are valid. No obvious best choice.

**Why This is Exceptional**: Death stops being an ending and becomes a *pivot point*. You're not passive at death—you're still playing. The game continues through death.

---

### 5. STYLE EMERGENCE (Player Identity System)

> *"You don't choose a class. Your class emerges from how you play."*

**The Concept**: Most games have classes you pick. This game has classes that *discover you*.

**Mechanics**:

| Feature | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Style Detection** | Game categorizes your emergent playstyle based on behavior | Identity feels earned |
| **Style Names** | "Aggressive Orbiter", "Careful Farmer", "Glass Cannon", "Kite Master" | Shareable identity |
| **Style-Matched Offers** | Upgrade offers weighted toward your demonstrated style | Feels like "my build" |
| **Style Evolution** | Watch your style change over many runs on a timeline | Meta-narrative |
| **Counter-Style Runs** | Occasional "style challenge": play opposite of your norm | Growth opportunity |

**Detection Dimensions**:

| Dimension | Low | High |
|-----------|-----|------|
| **Aggression** | Kites at max range | Facetanks enemies |
| **Risk** | Prioritizes health | Takes every damage |
| **Speed** | Careful positioning | Constant motion |
| **Focus** | Clears one enemy at a time | AoE everything |
| **Experimentation** | Same build every run | Different builds always |

**Implementation Laws**:
- **S1 No Reveal Until Stable**: Style isn't shown until 5+ runs to avoid gaming
- **S2 Soft Matching**: Style influences offers, doesn't dictate them
- **S3 Evolution Visible**: "Run 1-20: Careful Farmer → Run 21-50: Aggressive Orbiter"
- **S4 No Judgment**: All styles are valid. No "best" playstyle.

**Why This is Exceptional**: This creates identity that you EARN through play, not select at start. And it's PERSONAL—your style is uniquely yours, discovered through your actual behavior.

### 6. IMPOSSIBLE BARS (Raised Ceiling)

> *"The spec should make us sweat. Easy specs make mediocre games."*

**Current Fun Floor is too achievable.** Raise the bars to force excellence:

| Metric | Current Spec | Enlightened Spec |
|--------|--------------|------------------|
| **Input latency** | < 16ms | < 5ms (WASM required) |
| **Death attribution** | < 2 seconds to understand | < 0.5 seconds (instant knowing) |
| **Build viability** | 5 distinct builds | 100% viability (ANY path can win) |
| **Restart time** | < 3 seconds | < 1 second (feels instant) |
| **Synergy discovery** | 1+1 > 2 somewhere | Every pair of upgrades has emergent interaction |
| **Skill ceiling** | High | **Infinite** (speedrunner should never plateau) |
| **Emotional journey** | Traverse HOPE→FLOW→CRISIS | Player cries at least once per 100 runs (grief OR triumph) |

**New Impossible Bars**:

| Metric | Target | Why Impossible |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Zero unexplained deaths** | Player can predict death 2s before it happens | Requires perfect telegraph clarity |
| **Style fingerprint accuracy** | 90% style prediction by run 10 | Requires genuine pattern learning |
| **Crystal inheritance rate** | 50% of runs use inheritance | Requires compelling meta-layer |
| **"One more run" rate** | 95% immediate retry after death | Requires addictive loop perfection |
| **Run 100 feels different** | Demonstrably different experience from run 1 | Requires actual adaptation |

---

### 7. COMMUNITY WITNESS (Social Layer)

> *"Your deaths become seeds for strangers. Your crystals travel."*

**Currently Out of Scope**: Leaderboards, multiplayer, matchmaking.

**Proposed In Scope**: Asynchronous community layer through crystals.

**Mechanics**:

| Feature | Description | Why It Matters |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Crystal Sharing** | One-click share to get a unique crystal URL | Frictionless sharing |
| **Crystal Inheritance** | Anyone can start a run from any shared crystal | Community seed pool |
| **Lineage Tracking** | See who inherited your crystal and what they did | Legacy matters |
| **Crystal Reputation** | Crystals that produce good offspring get visibility | Natural selection |
| **Weekly Seeds** | Curated "crystal of the week" for community challenges | Shared experience |

**Why This is Exceptional**: This creates community WITHOUT competitive pressure. You're not fighting for leaderboard—you're contributing to a shared garden of builds. Your death becomes someone's opportunity.

---

## Summary: The Enlightened Game

| Feature | What It Adds |
|---------|--------------|
| **Adaptive Witness** | The game knows YOU |
| **Crystal Inheritance** | Deaths become seeds |
| **Arena Memory** | Personal geography |
| **Ritual Death** | Death is a choice |
| **Style Emergence** | Identity you earn |
| **Impossible Bars** | Forces excellence |
| **Community Witness** | Shared garden |

**The Pitch**:

> "A survivors-like where the game learns your patterns, your deaths become seeds for future runs, and the arena remembers everywhere you've ever died. Your playstyle emerges from behavior, not selection. Death isn't game over—it's the moment you shape your legacy."

**The Mirror Test**:

> *"Does this feel like Kent on his best day?"*

This is **daring**: No survivors-like has adaptive witnessing.
This is **bold**: Death as interactive ritual is genuinely new.
This is **creative**: Style emergence from behavior is unexplored.
This is **opinionated**: Crystals as seeds is a strong take.
This is **not gaudy**: All features serve the core philosophy.

## Implementation Priority

If implementing all is impossible, here's the priority order:

1. **Ritual Death** - Transforms the death moment (already the standout)
2. **Crystal Inheritance** - Creates meta-layer without power creep
3. **Arena Memory** - Personal geography deepens attachment
4. **Style Emergence** - Identity system creates stickiness
5. **Adaptive Witness** - Technical challenge but highest ceiling
6. **Community Witness** - Nice to have, not essential

## The Question This Answers

> "What imbues this project with unique, enduring value?"

**Current Answer**: The death screen philosophy.

**Enlightened Answer**: The game that knows you, remembers your deaths, and turns every ending into a beginning. Death isn't failure—it's contribution. Your crystal becomes someone else's seed. Your style is discovered, not chosen. The arena is yours, marked by a hundred past selves.

**This is the game that makes players say**: "It feels like the game is watching me. Learning me. And I can't stop playing because every death means something."

*"Every run crystallizes. Every crystal is a seed. Every death is a beginning."*
