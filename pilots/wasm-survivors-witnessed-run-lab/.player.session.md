# PLAYER Session — Run 028

**Agent**: PLAYER | **Timestamp**: 2025-12-27T19:55:00
**Phase**: DREAM | **Iteration**: 1

## MISSION: Iteration 1 — Research & Culture Grounding

> *"The player is the proof. The joy is the witness."*

### State Assessment

**The codebase is remarkably complete:**
- Full game loop at 60fps with tight input handling
- 8 verb-based upgrades (pierce, orbit, dash, multishot, vampiric, chain, burst, slow_field)
- 5 synergies (shotgun_drill, whirlwind, blood_rush, cascade, fireworks)
- 4 enemy types (basic, fast, tank, boss) with wave progression
- Complete juice system (particles, shake, clutch moments, vignette, combo)
- Sound engine, witness layer, death overlay

**CREATIVE's Refactor Target (DD-21)**: Pattern-Based Enemy Behaviors
- Transform enemies from "HP bags that chase" into "readable threats with learnable patterns"
- Add telegraphs: Shambler → Lunge, Rusher → Charge, Tank → Stomp, Boss → Combos
- Add Spitter (new ranged enemy)

### My Role in Iteration 1

PLAYER is advisory during DREAM phase. I will:
1. Research comparable games with pattern-based enemies
2. Build a mental model of what "learnable" feels like
3. Prepare test scenarios for when .build.ready exists
4. Document quality expectations in .player.culture.log.md

### Quality Bar (From PROTO_SPEC)

The spec defines clear success criteria I'll be testing against:

**Fun Floor (Non-Negotiable):**
- [ ] Input < 16ms — WASD feels *tight*
- [ ] Player can always move — No stun-lock
- [ ] Death = particles + sound + XP burst — No silent kills
- [ ] Level-up = Pause + choice + fanfare — A *moment*
- [ ] Death cause readable in < 2 seconds — "I died because X"
- [ ] Restart < 3 seconds — No menus
- [ ] Build identity by wave 5 — Player can name their build
- [ ] Synergy discovery — 1+1 > 2 somewhere
- [ ] Escalation visible — Wave 10 looks harder than wave 1
- [ ] 4+ enemy types with distinct behaviors
- [ ] 8+ upgrades that change playstyle

**The Key Question for DD-21:**
> Do the new enemy patterns feel "learnable" and "fair"?
> Can I tell WHY I died? Was it my failure to read the telegraph?

## Current Activity

✅ Read PROTO_SPEC.md — Internalized quality expectations
✅ Read existing codebase — Substantial infrastructure exists
✅ Reviewed CREATIVE's DD-21 offering — Pattern-based enemies
✅ Created PLAYER session files and signaled presence
✅ Researched 4 comparable games (VS, Gungeon, Hades, Brotato)
✅ Documented quality expectations and test scenarios
🎯 **ITERATION 1 COMPLETE**

---

## ITERATION 2-3 — Design Decision Analysis

✅ Read .outline.md — CREATIVE has locked DD-21 through DD-24
✅ Analyzed timing constants against comparable games
✅ Updated test scenarios with specific timing expectations
✅ Identified 5 concerns to watch in WITNESS phase
🎯 **ITERATIONS 2-3 COMPLETE**

### Key Findings

**Good**:
- Each enemy has ONE signature behavior (matches my research)
- Telegraph timings are in learnable range (0.3-0.8s)
- Spitter adds needed ranged variety

**Concerns**:
- Shambler 300ms may be tight for new players
- Rusher 200px charge at 3x speed — need to verify dodgeable
- Spitter 2000ms cooldown — may be too safe once learned

## ITERATION 4-7: BUILD Phase Observation

Phase: BUILD | Role: Observer/Preparer

While CREATIVE and ADVERSARIAL build, I will:
- Monitor their progress via .focus and .offerings files
- Refine my test scenarios based on implementation details
- Prepare for WITNESS phase (iteration 8)

**Hard Gate**: .build.ready must exist before I play.

## Partner Status

- **CREATIVE**: Active, entering iteration 4 (BUILD phase)
- **ADVERSARIAL**: Unknown (no files visible yet)
- **.build.ready**: Does not exist (expected — BUILD in progress)
