## Iteration 1: Comparable Games Research

### The Challenge

CREATIVE's DD-21 targets the enemy system: transforming enemies from "HP bags that chase" into "readable threats with learnable patterns."

**The core question**: What makes enemy patterns feel *learnable* vs *punishing*?

---

## Comparable Game: Vampire Survivors

**The standard-bearer of the genre.**

**What worked**:
- Enemies are *threats*, not puzzles — they swarm, you survive
- Upgrades are the primary expression, not dodging individual attacks
- "Learn the build, not the enemy" philosophy
- Death is always from being overwhelmed, not from missing a single dodge

**What didn't**:
- Individual enemies have no personality — they're just HP with speeds
- No "aha moment" of pattern recognition
- Skilled player vs. new player: difference is build knowledge, not mechanical execution

**Applies to our pilot because**:
- DD-21 is explicitly trying to add what Vampire Survivors lacks: enemy patterns
- Risk: If we add too much pattern complexity, we lose the "relax and survive" feel
- Balance: Patterns should enhance, not replace, the swarm dynamic

**Quality bar**: Enemies should still feel like *swarm members*, but individual types should have recognizable "tells" that reward attention.

---

## Comparable Game: Enter the Gungeon

**Top-down bullet hell with heavy pattern focus.**

**What worked**:
- Every enemy attack is telegraphed — wind-up animations, visual indicators
- Learning patterns = mastery progression (runs get easier with skill)
- Boss fights are pattern exams — "I know this attack, I know how to dodge it"
- Deaths feel *earned* — "I should have seen that coming"

**What didn't**:
- Can feel punishing to newcomers — too many unique patterns to learn
- Overwhelming in chaos — when 10 enemies fire, patterns become noise
- Requires significant investment before "flow state" emerges

**Applies to our pilot because**:
- DD-21's Rusher "charge in straight line with wind-up + line indicator" = Gungeon-style telegraph
- Need to ensure telegraphs remain readable when 20 enemies are on screen
- Risk: If every enemy telegraphs, the screen becomes a Christmas tree of warnings

**Quality bar**: Telegraphs should be distinct per enemy type, not a visual soup. When I die, I should know which telegraph I missed.

---

## Comparable Game: Hades

**Action roguelike with tight combat and clear enemy tells.**

**What worked**:
- Enemy wind-ups are *generous* — 0.3-0.5s is plenty to react
- Audio cues reinforce visual tells — "I hear the charge, I know to dodge"
- Enemies telegraph direction, not just "attack coming"
- Bosses have distinct phases — patterns escalate, mastery deepens

**What didn't**:
- Sometimes telegraphs are hidden behind particle effects
- Learning curve exists but skill ceiling is approachable

**Applies to our pilot because**:
- DD-21's proposed 0.3s red glow for Shambler lunge matches Hades timing
- Audio integration matters — we already have sound engine, use it for telegraphs
- Consider: charge direction indicator for Rusher (like Hades ground markers)

**Quality bar**: Telegraph timing should be generous (0.3-0.5s). I should never die thinking "I couldn't have reacted to that."

---

## Comparable Game: Brotato

**Survivors-like with action game combat feel.**

**What worked**:
- Enemies have behavioral variety — ranged, melee, chargers, spawners
- Movement is primary defense (like our spec demands)
- Upgrades combine in wild ways — build identity is strong
- Deaths are attributable — "I got cornered by chargers"

**What didn't**:
- Some enemy types feel samey — "just more HP"
- Telegraphs are minimal — relies more on pattern recognition through repetition

**Applies to our pilot because**:
- Brotato shows that *behavioral variety* > individual pattern complexity
- Our 5 enemy types (Shambler, Rusher, Spitter, Tank, Boss) could each have ONE signature behavior
- Risk: Trying to give every enemy multiple attacks waters down identity

**Quality bar**: Each enemy type should have ONE defining behavior. When I see the silhouette, I know what it will do.

---

## Synthesis: What "Learnable" Means

Based on this research, "learnable" enemies have:

1. **ONE Signature Behavior** — Each enemy type does ONE thing well
2. **Generous Telegraphs** — 0.3-0.5s of warning, not twitch-reaction demands
3. **Visual Distinctness** — Silhouette = behavior. No confusion in chaos.
4. **Audio Reinforcement** — Sound cue confirms visual telegraph
5. **Readable in Swarms** — Individual telegraphs work even when 20 enemies are present
6. **Fair Deaths** — "I knew it was coming, I messed up" not "I couldn't have seen that"

## Quality Expectations for WITNESS Phase

When .build.ready exists, I will test:

### Basics (Iteration 8)
- [ ] Does it render?
- [ ] Can I move? (WASD tight?)
- [ ] Can I die?
- [ ] Can I restart?
- [ ] Is there feedback on actions?

### Pattern Learning (Iteration 9)
- [ ] Can I recognize each enemy type by silhouette/color?
- [ ] Do telegraphs give me 0.3-0.5s to react?
- [ ] When I die, can I name the specific attack that killed me?
- [ ] After 3 runs, am I noticeably better at dodging specific attacks?
- [ ] Do audio cues reinforce visual telegraphs?

### Unique Value (Iteration 10)
- [ ] Does this feel different from Vampire Survivors?
- [ ] Is the pattern-learning rewarding, or frustrating?
- [ ] Would I tell a friend about this?
- [ ] What makes this worth playing?

## Prepared Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Lunge
**Setup**: Wave 1, encounter Shambler
**Expected**: See red glow for 0.3s before lunge. Sidestep feels intentional.
**Failure**: Lunge happens too fast to read, or telegraph is invisible.

### Scenario 2: Rusher Gauntlet
**Setup**: Wave 3+, multiple Rushers on screen
**Expected**: Each Rusher's charge line indicator is distinct. I can weave between them.
**Failure**: Charge indicators overlap into visual noise. I can't tell which one to dodge first.

### Scenario 3: Tank Stomp
**Setup**: Wave 4+, encounter Tank
**Expected**: See ground marker, have ~0.5s to get out of radius. Clear feedback on escape.
**Failure**: Stomp is too fast, or radius is unclear.

### Scenario 4: Spitter Aim
**Setup**: Wave 2+, Spitter appears
**Expected**: See aim indicator for 0.5s, can strafe or use cover (if cover exists).
**Failure**: Projectile feels unavoidable, or aim indicator is too subtle.

### Scenario 5: Boss Combo
**Setup**: Wave 5 (boss wave)
**Expected**: Boss telegraphs a sequence (charge → stomp → projectiles). I can learn and predict.
**Failure**: Boss attacks are random, or sequence is unreadable.

## Iteration 2-3: DD-21 to DD-24 Analysis

CREATIVE has locked design decisions. Let me evaluate them against my research:

### DD-21: Pattern-Based Enemy Behaviors — ✅ GOOD

**Assessment**: This matches my research findings exactly.
- Each enemy type gets ONE signature behavior
- Clear state machine: CHASE → TELEGRAPH → ATTACK → RECOVERY
- Spitter adds ranged variety (a gap in the current system)

**Potential Concern**: The spec says enemies should still feel like "swarm members." Need to ensure individual patterns don't slow down the overall flow too much.

### DD-22: Telegraph Visual System — ✅ GOOD

| Attack | Visual | Timing | Verdict |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| Lunge | Red glow + scale 1.2x | 300ms | ✅ Matches Hades feel |
| Charge | Orange line indicator | 400ms | ✅ Clear directional cue |
| Stomp | Red ground circle | 600ms | ✅ Generous, learnable |
| Projectile | Purple aim laser | 500ms | ✅ Clear, distinct color |

**Potential Concern**: Color contrast. Will purple aim laser be visible against dark backgrounds? Will red glow blend with enemy color (already red)?

**Suggestion for testing**: Pay attention to visual clarity in waves 5+ when many enemies are on screen.

### DD-23: Attack Timing Constants — ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING

| Enemy | Telegraph | Attack | Recovery | Total Cycle |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|-------------|
| Shambler | 300ms | 100ms | 500ms | 900ms |
| Rusher | 400ms | 300ms | 800ms | 1500ms |
| Spitter | 500ms | 50ms | 2000ms | 2550ms |
| Tank | 600ms | 200ms | 1000ms | 1800ms |
| Boss | 800ms | varies | 500ms | long |

**Assessment**: Telegraph timings look reasonable (0.3-0.8s range = learnable).

**Potential Concerns**:
1. **Shambler 300ms may be tight** for new players — Gungeon's basic enemies telegraph longer
2. **Spitter 2000ms recovery** is VERY long — may feel too safe once you learn it
3. **Rusher 400ms + 200px charge** — Does player have enough time to sidestep 200px?

**Key Test Questions**:
- Is 300ms enough to react to Shambler lunge?
- Is Rusher charge dodgeable at 3x speed over 200px?
- Does Spitter feel threatening with 2s cooldown?

### DD-24: Spitter Enemy Type — ✅ GOOD

**Assessment**: Ranged enemy adds variety. Key specs:
- Prefers 100-150px range (keeps distance)
- Destroyable projectiles (skill expression: shoot them down)
- Purple color = distinct from red melee enemies

**Potential Concern**: "Destroyable" projectiles — does our attack system support this? Need to verify in playtest.

---

## Updated Test Scenarios (Iteration 3)

### Scenario 1a: Shambler Lunge Reaction Time
**Setup**: Wave 1, stand still as Shambler approaches
**Test**: When red glow appears, can I sidestep before lunge completes?
**Pass**: Sidestep feels intentional and comfortable
**Fail**: Lunge feels too fast, like "gotcha" damage

### Scenario 2a: Rusher Charge Escape
**Setup**: Wave 3+, Rusher locks onto me
**Test**: When orange line appears, can I move perpendicular to escape 200px charge zone?
**Pass**: Dodge feels like a skill I can master
**Fail**: Charge moves faster than I can escape

### Scenario 3a: Spitter Projectile Destruction
**Setup**: Wave 2+, Spitter aims at me
**Test**: Can I shoot down the projectile? Is this intuitive?
**Pass**: Shooting projectiles feels rewarding
**Fail**: Projectile too small/fast to hit, or mechanic not obvious

### Scenario 4a: Tank Stomp Escape
**Setup**: Wave 4+, Tank approaches
**Test**: When ground circle appears, can I exit 60px radius in 600ms?
**Pass**: Escape feels learnable, not frantic
**Fail**: 600ms + 60px = impossible at current move speed

### Scenario 5a: Boss Combo Pattern
**Setup**: Wave 5 boss fight
**Test**: Can I identify the 3-phase pattern (charge → stomp → barrage)?
**Pass**: After 2 deaths, I know the pattern and can articulate it
**Fail**: Pattern feels random or phases blend together

---

## Concerns to Watch in WITNESS Phase

1. **Swarm Dynamic**: Do pattern-based enemies still feel like a swarm, or does combat slow down?
2. **Visual Clarity at Scale**: Are telegraphs visible when 15+ enemies are on screen?
3. **Color Contrast**: Do purple (Spitter) and red (others) remain distinct in chaos?
4. **Recovery Windows**: Do recovery phases feel exploitable, or like "wait time"?
5. **Spitter Threat Level**: Is 2s cooldown too long? Does Spitter feel dangerous?
