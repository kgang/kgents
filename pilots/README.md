# Pilots

> *"Every week validates infrastructure THROUGH a pilot, not in isolation."*

Pilots are validation experiments for the kgents framework. Each is a compact, high-delight proof that the categorical foundation and witness layer actually work in real domains.

*"Tasteful > feature-complete"* applies here: pilots are intentionally small. A pilot that does one thing with depth beats one that does five things shallowly. *"Depth over breadth."*

## The Five Pilots

| Pilot | Domain | Joy Type | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| **[Trail to Crystal](./trail-to-crystal-daily-lab/PROTO_SPEC.md)** | Productivity | FLOW | Production |
| **[Wasm Survivors](./wasm-survivors-game/PROTO_SPEC.md)** | Gaming | FLOW | Active |
| **[Disney Portal](./disney-portal-planner/PROTO_SPEC.md)** | Consumer | WARMTH | Spec |
| **[Rap Coach](./rap-coach-flow-lab/PROTO_SPEC.md)** | Creative | SURPRISE | Spec |
| **[Sprite Lab](./sprite-procedural-taste-lab/PROTO_SPEC.md)** | Generative | SURPRISE | Spec |

### Joy Types

- **FLOW**: The experience disappears into doing. Time dilates. Actions feel inevitable.
- **WARMTH**: The experience feels earned, personal, worth sharing. Days feel whole.
- **SURPRISE**: The experience delights through emergence. The system shows you something unexpected about yourself.

## The Wedge Pilot: Trail to Crystal

Trail to Crystal is the **wedge**—the pilot that proves the core thesis before the others can build on it.

The thesis: *actions are proofs, not just events.* Every mark captures intent. Every trace is immutable. Every crystal compresses meaning without losing it. If this works for daily productivity logging—the most mundane domain—it works anywhere.

**Why productivity?** Because:
- Everyone has days
- Everyone makes choices
- Everyone wonders where the time went

If the witness layer can make *that* feel meaningful without adding friction, the categorical foundation is sound.

## Validation Philosophy

Pilots are not products. They are **experiments** that stress-test infrastructure:

```
Week N: Pick a pilot
        Build/extend with current infrastructure
        Surface what's missing or broken
        Fix infrastructure (not just the pilot)
        Witness what worked
```

The goal is **validated leverage**. Each pilot should require less boilerplate than the last because the primitives are getting stronger.

### What Pilots Prove

| Primitive | How Pilots Validate |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Mark** | Can decisions be captured without friction? |
| **Trace** | Does immutability feel honest, not oppressive? |
| **Crystal** | Does compression preserve meaning? |
| **Galois** | Does drift surface clearly? |
| **Ghost** | Do unchosen paths teach us anything? |

## Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Production** | Deployed, validated, daily driver |
| **Active** | In development, core path works |
| **Spec** | Spec complete, awaiting implementation |
| **Incubating** | Exploring, not committed |

---

## Shared Substrate

All pilots compose the same kgents primitives:

```
Mark      captures decision with intent, weights, context
Trace     immutable history of marks
Crystal   compressive proof (meaning, not summary)
Compass   constitutional alignment visualization
Trail     navigation + evidence anchors
Galois    drift/coherence/loss signal
Ghost     unchosen alternatives (roads not taken)
```

The Composition Chain in each pilot's PROTO_SPEC shows exactly how these flow.

---

## Anti-Success

Every pilot defines failure modes. These are not edge cases—they are the gravitational pull every system must resist:

- **Surveillance creep**: witnessing adds drag, changes behavior
- **Judgment leakage**: descriptive becomes evaluative
- **Highlight theater**: proofs become reels
- **Coldness**: crystals read like reports
- **Gap shame**: honest rest becomes invisible

If a pilot can't resist these, it hasn't earned its place.
