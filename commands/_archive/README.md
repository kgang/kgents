# Archived Slash Commands

This directory contains archived slash commands that were used during development phases that are now complete.

## Purpose

- **Historical Reference**: See how commands evolved
- **Pattern Mining**: Extract useful patterns for future commands
- **Documentation**: Understand what phases were completed

## Archive Policy

Commands are archived when:
1. The feature/phase they guided is 100% complete
2. The canonical spec or docs now serve the purpose
3. The command would cause confusion if still active

## Current Archives

| Command | Archived | Reason | See Instead |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| `os-shell.md` | 2025-12-17 | Implementation complete | `spec/protocols/os-shell.md` |

## Note

These files are tracked in git (unlike `plans/_archive/`) because they serve as reference for future command design patterns.
