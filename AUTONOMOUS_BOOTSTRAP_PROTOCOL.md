# Autonomous Bootstrap Protocol

**A meta-level protocol for Kent + Claude Code to implement kgents.**

This document is self-referential: Claude Code reads it to guide implementation, and the implementation validates the protocol.

---

## Core Principle: Autopoiesis First

**Use kgents to build kgents from the FIRST line of code.**

```python
# Step 0: Before writing ANY implementation
from runtime import ClaudeCLIRuntime
from agents.k import kgent, DialogueMode, DialogueInput
from agents.a import creativity_coach, CreativityInput, CreativityMode

runtime = ClaudeCLIRuntime()

# Use K-gent for naming decisions
name = await runtime.execute(kgent(), DialogueInput(
    message="What should I name this component?",
    mode=DialogueMode.ADVISE
))

# Use CreativityCoach for design exploration
design = await runtime.execute(creativity_coach(), CreativityInput(
    seed="the problem I'm solving",
    mode=CreativityMode.EXPAND
))
```

**Autopoiesis Score** = (lines generated by kgents agents) / (total lines)
- Target: >50%
- Measure this. Track it. Improve it.

## The Protocol

### Principle: Heterarchical Collaboration

Neither Kent nor Claude Code is "in charge." The collaboration is heterarchical:
- **Kent provides Ground**: preferences, judgment calls, domain knowledge
- **Claude Code provides Fix**: iteration, exploration, mechanical translation
- **Both apply Judge**: reviewing against the 7 principles

### Principle: Spec Before Impl

1. Write specification in `spec/{letter}-gents/`
2. Read spec completely before implementing
3. Implement as mechanical translation
4. Validate: `Contradict(impl, spec) = None`

---

## Required Patterns

### Pattern: Events are Sublate Traces

State changes MUST emit events:
```python
# WRONG
del self._sessions[id]
return True

# RIGHT
del self._sessions[id]
await self._emit_event(SessionRemoved(session_id=id))
return True
```

### Pattern: Ground Includes Environment

Shell, platform, package structure are Ground—explicit, not assumed:
```python
# WRONG: Assumes bash
command = "read -p 'prompt' var"

# RIGHT: POSIX is Ground
command = "printf 'prompt ' && read var"
```

**Ground checklist**:
- [ ] Shell commands are POSIX-compatible
- [ ] Package structure in `pyproject.toml` (no `sys.path` hacks)
- [ ] Config defaults merge, not overwrite
- [ ] Framework constraints documented

### Pattern: Fix Needs Memory

Fixed-point iteration carries state:
```python
# WRONG: Stateless
def detect(session) -> Result:
    return Result(confidence=0.2)

# RIGHT: Stateful
def detect(session, previous: Result) -> Result:
    if current_state == previous.state:
        return Result(confidence=min(1.0, previous.confidence + 0.2))
    return Result(state=current_state, confidence=0.2)
```

### Pattern: Sublate, Don't Overwrite

Merge configurations, preserve both sides:
```python
# WRONG
config = data.get("config", {})

# RIGHT
config = {**defaults, **data.get("config", {})}
```

### Pattern: Conflicts are Data

Never swallow exceptions silently:
```python
# WRONG
except Exception:
    pass

# RIGHT
except Exception as e:
    self.log.warning(f"Conflict: {e}")
```

## Execution Protocol

### For Each Implementation Phase

```
LOOP:
  1. Use kgents agents to explore design (CreativityCoach, K-gent)
  2. Read relevant spec
  3. Implement (mechanically translate, use LLM to generate boilerplate)
  4. Kent reviews (Judge)
  5. IF accept: mark complete, next phase
     ELIF revise: Claude Code modifies
     ELIF reject: discuss, potentially Sublate
```

### Termination (Fix)

Implementation is complete when:
```python
def protocol_complete() -> bool:
    return all([
        spec_exists(f"spec/{letter}-gents/"),
        impl_exists(f"impl/claude-openrouter/agents/{letter}/"),
        Judge(impl, Principles).verdict == "accept",
        Contradict(impl, spec) is None,
        autopoiesis_score() > 0.5,
        kent_approves(),
    ])
```

## Meta-Instructions for Claude Code

When reading this document:

1. **Instantiate runtime FIRST** — Before any implementation
2. **Use K-gent for naming** — Don't guess, ask
3. **Use CreativityCoach for design** — Explore before coding
4. **Read specs completely** — Understand before implementing
5. **Apply the 7 patterns** — Events, Ground, Fix memory, Sublate merge, Conflicts as data
6. **Measure autopoiesis** — Track what kgents generated vs. manual

### On Tensions

If you encounter contradictions:
1. Surface them explicitly (Contradict)
2. Propose synthesis or hold (Sublate)
3. Let Kent decide (Judge)

### On Uncertainty

If spec is unclear:
1. Use HypothesisEngine to generate possibilities
2. Ask Kent for clarification
3. Propose and iterate (Fix)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Begin new implementation:
claude "Read AUTONOMOUS_BOOTSTRAP_PROTOCOL.md. I want to implement {X}. Start by using CreativityCoach to explore the design space."
```

## Self-Description

This protocol is itself an application of bootstrap agents:

| Protocol Element | Bootstrap Agent |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "Ground" section | Ground |
| Phase ordering | Compose |
| Kent checkpoints | Judge |
| Termination condition | Fix |
| "On Tensions" section | Contradict + Sublate |
| Autopoiesis imperative | Id (self-reference) |

The protocol bootstraps the bootstrap.
