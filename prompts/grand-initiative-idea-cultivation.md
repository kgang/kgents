## The System Has Evolved

Since these ideas were generated, kgents has grown significantly:

### New Capabilities Available

| Capability | What It Enables |
|------------|-----------------|
| **N-Phase Cycle** | Structured 11-phase lifecycle with auto-continuation |
| **Reactive Substrate** | Target-agnostic widgets (CLI/TUI/Marimo/JSON) |
| **Signal[T] / Computed[T]** | Observable state with reactive updates |
| **Pure Entropy Algebra** | Deterministic visual effects from entropy |
| **GlyphWidget** | Atomic visual unit that projects to all targets |
| **AGENTESE Logos** | Universal protocol for agent-world interaction |
| **PolyAgent[S, A, B]** | State-dependent behavior with polynomials |
| **Flux Functor** | Event-driven stream processing |
| **K-gent Soul (97%)** | LLM-backed dialogue with eigenvectors |

### Architecture Decisions in Effect

- **AD-001**: Agents are Morphisms (compose via `>>`)
- **AD-002**: Functors Lift Agents (structure-preserving transformation)
- **AD-003**: Grammars Generate (define rules, not instances)
- **AD-004**: Hotdata over Coldspec (pre-computed LLM outputs)
- **AD-005**: N-Phase Cycle (SENSE → ACT → REFLECT)

---

## Your Mission

Execute a **multi-cycle cultivation campaign** with the following phases:

### Cycle 1: HARVEST & TRIAGE (This Session)

**Goal**: Read, digest, and classify all ideas with fresh eyes

```markdown
PLAN:     Read all 15 sessions + kentspicks + strategic-recommendations
RESEARCH: Map ideas to current architecture; identify what's now trivial
DEVELOP:  Create tiered implementation strategy
STRATEGIZE: Sequence for maximum impact and joy
REFLECT:  Update master-plan with current system capabilities
```

**Key Questions**:
1. Which ideas are now **trivially implementable** with reactive substrate?
2. Which ideas compose with **existing components**?
3. Which ideas require **new architecture**?
4. Which ideas **Kent explicitly loves** (kentspicks.md)?

### Cycle 2: QUICK WINS SPRINT

**Goal**: Implement 10-15 highest-joy, lowest-effort ideas

**Candidates** (from kentspicks + crown-jewels):
```
kg whatif     - Show 3 alternatives (10.0 priority, effort 1)
kg soul vibe  - One-liner soul state (10.0, effort 1)
kg oblique    - Brian Eno strategies (12.0!, effort 1)
kg parse      - Universal parser CLI (10.0, effort 1)
kg dialectic  - Hegelian synthesis (10.0, effort 1)
kg shadow     - Jungian shadow analysis (10.0, effort 1)
kg approve    - "Would Kent approve?" (10.0, effort 1)
kg feel       - Proprioception query (10.0, effort 2)
```

**Pattern**: Use `plans/skills/cli-command.md` for each

### Cycle 3: REACTIVE WIDGETS

**Goal**: Build visual primitives using new reactive substrate

**From session-11 (I-gent Visualization) + reactive substrate**:
```python
# These now compose with GlyphWidget!
SparklineWidget  - Mini trend line
BarWidget        - Progress visualization
DensityField     - 2D visual texture
SoulGlyph        - Personality as visual
WeatherWidget    - Entropy as weather metaphor
```

**Pattern**: Each widget projects to CLI/TUI/Marimo/JSON

### Cycle 4: CROSS-POLLINATION SYNTHESIS

**Goal**: Implement the best combo ideas from session-14

**Top Combinations**:
```
C01: "Would Kent Approve?" (K + Judge)
C03: Living Garden Viz (I + Flux)
C04: Soul Tension Detector (K + Contradict)
C22: "What Would Kent Synthesize?" (K + H-hegel + H-jung)
C32: Ethical Code Review (K + Judge + Code)
```

### Cycle 5: CROWN JEWELS COMPLETION

**Goal**: All 45+ perfect-10 ideas implemented

---

## Execution Protocol

For each implementation:

```markdown
1. PLAN
   - Read idea from session file
   - Check for existing implementation
   - Identify dependencies and files to touch
   - Declare scope in TodoWrite

2. RESEARCH
   - Map to current architecture
   - Find reusable components
   - Check for conflicts with AD-001 through AD-005

3. DEVELOP
   - Design API/CLI interface
   - Write type signatures
   - Sketch test cases

4. IMPLEMENT
   - Write code (use patterns from plans/skills/)
   - Write tests alongside
   - Run mypy/ruff continuously

5. QA
   - Checklist: types, linting, security
   - Verify composition laws hold

6. TEST
   - Property tests for invariants
   - Integration tests for wiring
   - Hotdata fixtures where applicable

7. REFLECT
   - Did this spark joy?
   - What surprised us?
   - What composes with what?
   - Update meta.md if learning is atomic
```

---

## Parallel Agent Strategy

When spawning agents for parallel work:

```
Track A: CLI Handlers (pure wiring)
         Agent: Implement handlers in impl/claude/protocols/cli/handlers/

Track B: Agent Enhancements (business logic)
         Agent: Enhance agents in impl/claude/agents/{k,h,u,p,i}/

Track C: Reactive Widgets (visual primitives)
         Agent: Build widgets in impl/claude/agents/i/reactive/primitives/

Track D: Tests & Documentation
         Agent: Write tests and update docs in parallel
```

---

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Quick Wins Shipped | 15+ | Commands working in CLI |
| Crown Jewels Complete | 25+ | Perfect 10.0 ideas live |
| Reactive Widgets Built | 5+ | Primitives projecting to all targets |
| Tests Passing | All | `uv run pytest` green |
| Kent's Joy | High | "This is amazing" achieved |

---

## Kent's Preferences (From _focus.md)

```
TOP PRIORITY: Functioning, sophisticated LLM-backed agents, live in k-terrarium
              Kent says "this is amazing" to the agent (HARD REQUIREMENT)

CURRENT INTENT (2025-12-12 evening):
  * VISUAL UIs/Refined interactions *
  * MONEY GENERATING (planning) *
  * FUN YET TECHNICAL *

CONSTRAINTS:
  - Depth over breadth (category theory, not feature sprawl)
  - The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?
  - Composability is paramount (agents compose via `>>`)
  - Meta files stay terse (butterfly in molasses warning)
```

## Handles Created

```
concept.ideas.manifest[filter=crown-jewels]     → 45+ perfect ideas
concept.ideas.manifest[filter=quick-wins]       → 70+ low-effort wins
concept.ideas.manifest[filter=kentspicks]       → Kent's curated favorites
self.substrate.manifest                         → Reactive widget system
self.soul.manifest                              → K-gent eigenvectors
time.ideas.witness                              → Implementation progress
void.entropy.sip[amount=0.10]                   → 10% exploration budget
```

---

## Entropy Budget

```
Exploration (10%):  Try unexpected compositions
                    Follow tangents that spark joy
                    Implement one idea just because it's fun

Production (90%):   Systematic implementation
                    Test coverage
                    Documentation
```

---

## Continuation Generator

Upon completing Cycle 1, emit:

```markdown
/hydrate
# QUICK WINS SPRINT ← HARVEST & TRIAGE

## ATTACH

handles: triaged=${ideas_classified}; trivial=${trivially_implementable};
         compose=${composable_with_existing}; new=${requires_new_arch};
         loved=${kent_favorites}; ledger=${phase_ledger}

mission: Implement 10-15 highest-joy, lowest-effort ideas from triage.

actions: For each quick win:
         1. Create handler in impl/claude/protocols/cli/handlers/
         2. Wire to existing agents or create minimal new logic
         3. Write tests
         4. Verify kg <command> works

exit: 10+ quick wins shipping; joy confirmed; continuation → REACTIVE WIDGETS.
```

## The Time Is Now

The system is ready. The reactive substrate breathes. The N-Phase Cycle turns. 600+ ideas await cultivation.

Begin with Cycle 1: **HARVEST & TRIAGE**.

Read. Digest. Classify. Then build with joy.
