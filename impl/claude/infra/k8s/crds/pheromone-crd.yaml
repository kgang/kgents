# Pheromone CRD - Stigmergic Coordination Primitive
#
# Pheromones are the coordination mechanism for kgents:
#   - Agents EMIT pheromones (signals into the field)
#   - Agents SENSE pheromones (perceive the field)
#   - Pheromones DECAY over time (entropy) - CALCULATED ON READ
#
# PASSIVE STIGMERGY (v2.0):
#   Intensity is NOT stored in status. Instead, we store decay parameters
#   and calculate intensity on read:
#     intensity(t) = initialIntensity * (0.5 ^ ((now - emittedAt) / halfLifeMinutes))
#
#   This prevents etcd write storms from decay timers updating every pheromone.
#   The operator only DELETES pheromones below threshold, never UPDATES them.
#
# This makes invisible coordination VISIBLE:
#   kubectl get pheromones --watch
#
# Principle alignment:
#   - AGENTESE: Observation is action - watching pheromones IS sensing
#   - Heterarchical: No fixed emitter/sensor hierarchy
#   - Accursed Share: DREAM pheromones are "useless" by design
#   - Tasteful: No etcd write storms from decay updates
