# Pheromone CRD - Stigmergic Coordination Primitive
#
# Pheromones are the coordination mechanism for kgents:
#   - Agents EMIT pheromones (signals into the field)
#   - Agents SENSE pheromones (perceive the field)
#   - Pheromones DECAY over time (entropy)
#
# This makes invisible coordination VISIBLE:
#   kubectl get pheromones --watch
#
# Principle alignment:
#   - AGENTESE: Observation is action - watching pheromones IS sensing
#   - Heterarchical: No fixed emitter/sensor hierarchy
#   - Accursed Share: DREAM pheromones are "useless" by design
