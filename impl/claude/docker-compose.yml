# Docker Compose for kgents local development
#
# Provides PostgreSQL with pgvector for D-gent persistence and semantic search.
#
# Usage:
#   docker compose up -d              # Start services
#   docker compose down               # Stop services
#   docker compose down -v            # Stop and delete volumes
#
# Environment variables are auto-loaded from .env file.
# To use in your shell: source .env
#
# Crown Jewels (Brain, etc.) automatically detect and use Postgres
# when KGENTS_POSTGRES_URL is set. Falls back to SQLite otherwise.
#
# pgvector: The pgvector/pgvector:pg16 image includes the vector extension
# pre-installed for semantic search on trail embeddings.
#
# Test Database:
#   A separate Postgres instance on port 5433 is provided for tests.
#   Tests auto-detect and use this when PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST is set.
#   This isolates test operations from your development data.
#
#   Manual override: KGENTS_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://...
