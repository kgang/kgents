# Hypergraph Editor — Constitutional Navigation

> *"The file is a lie. There is only the graph."*

**Galois Loss**: 0.35

## Derivation

```
COMPOSE + SHEAF + WITNESS → Hypergraph Editor
"Modal editing + monadic isolation + view coherence"
```

## The Paradigm Shift

| Traditional Editor | Hypergraph Editor |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Open a file | Focus a node |
| Go to line 42 | Traverse an edge |
| Save | Commit to cosmos (with witness) |
| Browse directories | Navigate siblings (gj/gk) |
| Use find-in-files | Use graph search (g/) |
| Organize by folder | Organize by derivation |

## The Six Editing Modes

```
NORMAL ─┬─ 'i' ──→ INSERT  (edit content, K-Block isolation active)
        ├─ 'ge' ─→ EDGE    (connect nodes via derivation)
        ├─ 'v'  ─→ VISUAL  (select multiple nodes)
        ├─ ':' ──→ COMMAND (AGENTESE invocation)
        └─ 'gw' ─→ WITNESS (mark moments)
```

## Graph Navigation

```
gh    Parent (inverse derives_from edge)
gl    Child (forward derives_from edge)
gj    Next sibling (same parent)
gk    Prev sibling
gd    Go to definition (implements edge)
gr    Go to references (inverse implements)
```
