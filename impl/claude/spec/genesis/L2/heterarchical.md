# HETERARCHICAL — The Flux Principle

> *"Agents exist in flux, not fixed hierarchy."*

**Galois Loss**: 0.45 (Kent rated CATEGORICAL upon seeing the theorem!)

## Derivation

```
A2 (Morphism) → COMPOSABLE → HETERARCHICAL
"In a category, no morphism has intrinsic privilege"
```

## Definition

**Heterarchical** means agents exist in flux, not fixed hierarchy.

### The Core Theorem

```
In a category, no morphism has intrinsic privilege.
All morphisms are arrows.
Therefore: heterarchy follows from categorical structure.
```

If agents are morphisms, hierarchical privilege is mathematically impossible.

### The Test

Ask: **"Can this agent both lead and follow?"**

### Mandates

| Mandate | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Heterarchy over hierarchy** | No fixed "boss" agent |
| **Temporal composition** | Agents compose across time |
| **Resource flux** | Compute flows where needed |
| **Entanglement** | Agents may share state without ownership |
