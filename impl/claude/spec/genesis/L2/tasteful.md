# TASTEFUL — The Aesthetic Principle

> *"Each agent serves a clear, justified purpose."*

**Galois Loss**: 0.08

## Derivation

```
A3 (Mirror) → JUDGE → TASTEFUL
"Judge applied to aesthetics via Mirror"
```

## Definition

**Tasteful** means each agent serves a clear, justified purpose. It is the
application of Judge (L1) to aesthetic considerations via the Mirror (A3).

### The Test

Ask: **"Does this feel right?"**

This invokes A3 (Mirror) directly—Kent's somatic response to the design.

### Mandates

| Mandate | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Say "no" more than "yes"** | Not every idea deserves an agent |
| **Avoid feature creep** | An agent does one thing well |
| **Aesthetic matters** | Interface should feel considered |
| **Justify existence** | "Why does this need to exist?" |

### Anti-Patterns

- Kitchen-sink agents that do "everything"
- Feature sprawl with 100 options
- Just-in-case additions
- Copy-paste agents with minor variations
