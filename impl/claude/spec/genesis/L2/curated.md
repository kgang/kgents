# CURATED — The Selection Principle

> *"Intentional selection over exhaustive cataloging."*

**Galois Loss**: 0.09

## Derivation

```
JUDGE + GROUND → CURATED
"Judge applied to Ground-derived selection"
```

## Definition

**Curated** means intentional selection over exhaustive cataloging. It combines
Judge (what should exist?) with Ground (what does exist?).

### The Test

Ask: **"Is this unique and necessary?"**

### Mandates

| Mandate | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Quality over quantity** | 10 excellent agents > 100 mediocre |
| **Every agent earns its place** | No parking lot of half-baked ideas |
| **Evolve, don't accumulate** | Remove what no longer serves |

### Anti-Patterns

- "Awesome list" sprawl cataloging everything
- Duplicative agents with slight variations
- Legacy nostalgia keeping agents for sentiment
- Completionist compulsion ("one of each")
