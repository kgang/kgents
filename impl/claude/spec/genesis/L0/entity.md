# A1: Entity — There Exist Things

> *"The irreducible claim that something IS."*

## Definition

**A1 (Entity)**: There exist things.

In category-theoretic terms: There exist *objects* in a category.

## Why Irreducible

You cannot prove existence from non-existence. The claim that "something is"
must be *given*, not derived. It is the first act of creation.

Without entities:
- There is nothing to compose
- There is nothing to judge
- There is nothing to ground

## What It Grounds

- The existence of agents as objects in a category
- The existence of prompts, documents, specs
- The existence of Kent as the human oracle
- All representations in the system

## AGENTESE Context

```
world.*     → entities in the external world
self.*      → entities in the internal self
concept.*   → entities in the abstract realm
```

## Loss Properties

```
L(A1) = 0.002     # Near-zero: fixed point of restructuring
```

A1 is self-describing: the statement "things exist" is itself a thing.
