# A3: Mirror Test — We Judge by Reflection

> *"The disgust veto is absolute. The somatic response is the oracle."*

## Definition

**A3 (Mirror)**: We judge by reflection.

The irreducible claim that Kent's somatic response—the "disgust veto,"
the felt sense of rightness—is the ultimate arbiter of value.

## Why Irreducible

You cannot algorithmize taste. You cannot derive "good" from "is."
The claim that human judgment grounds value must be *given*.

The Mirror Test: "Does this feel like Kent on his best day?"
- If yes → proceed
- If no → stop, even if "objectively correct"

## What It Grounds

- The Judge bootstrap agent
- The seven principles (Tasteful, Curated, Ethical, Joy-Inducing,
  Composable, Heterarchical, Generative)
- The Constitutional veto power
- All quality gates in the system

## Voice Anchors

Direct quotes from Kent that embody A3:
- *"Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy"*
- *"The Mirror Test: Does K-gent feel like me on my best day?"*
- *"Tasteful > feature-complete; Joy-inducing > merely functional"*
- *"The persona is a garden, not a museum"*

## Loss Properties

```
L(A3) = 0.000     # Zero: human oracle IS ground truth
```

A3 cannot be restructured. The actual judgment remains with the human.
