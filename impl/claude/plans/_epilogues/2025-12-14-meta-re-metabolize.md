                                             REFLECT
                                                    ↓
                                    {PLAN | META | ⟂[DETACH]}
```

All transitions verified with proper halt conditions (`⟂[BLOCKED:*]`, `⟂[ENTROPY_DEPLETED]`).

### Ledger/Entropy Format

All skills use consistent format:
```yaml
phase_ledger:
  PHASE: touched|skipped|deferred
entropy:
  planned: 0.05
  spent: N
  returned: M
```

### Law Verification

| Law | Status |
|-----|--------|
| Identity | ✅ `/hydrate` grounding in all generators |
| Associativity | ✅ Phase composition chains correctly |
| Termination | ✅ All paths reach `⟂` via REFLECT |

## Findings

### No Drift Detected

The lifecycle added during 2025-12-13 (Phase Accountability, Branching Protocol, Auto-Inducer, Process Metrics) remains coherent. Recent QA learnings (enum identity, DI patterns, HTTP validation) are implementation-level and do not require skill-level integration.

### No Redundancies to Prune

Related Skills sections are intentionally duplicated in each Continuation Generator for standalone reference.

### Accursed Share Health

All 11 skills have 4 well-seeded entropy prompts. No re-seeding needed.

## No Changes Made

This was a verification pass. The lifecycle is healthy.

## Next

No follow-on work surfaced. Return to normal operations.
