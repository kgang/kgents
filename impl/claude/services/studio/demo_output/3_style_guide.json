      "rationale": "High contrast between player and enemy creates visual clarity in the chaos. Gold becomes precious by scarcity\u2014reserved for crystalline moments of understanding."

      "rule": "Headers use Space Grotesk at 1.414x scale increments. Body text is Inter. Code is JetBrains Mono. Never mix fonts within a component.",

      "category": "motion",
      "rule": "All animations use cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) with 240ms entrance, 180ms exit, 360ms emphasis. No bouncing, elastic, or 'playful' easing.",

      "rule": "Static is default. Only animate on state change, never for decoration. Loading states pulse once per 2 seconds maximum.",
      "rationale": "Motion is earned through meaning. Constant animation dilutes impact and suggests nervous energy rather than confident control."
