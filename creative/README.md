> *"The persona is a garden, not a museum."*

This is the garden's experimental corner—where personal creative projects take root and grow at their own pace.

## What This Is

**Exploration artifacts.** Personal creative experiments that live alongside the kgents framework but are not part of it.

These projects share kgents' values (tasteful, curated, ethical, joy-inducing) without being bound to its technical architecture. They're free to be messy, half-formed, and exploratory.

---

## What This Isn't

- Not production code
- Not specifications requiring implementation
- Not part of the kgents agent taxonomy

The core framework lives in `spec/` and `impl/`. This directory is for *creative output*—ideas that might become shows, channels, or simply remain seeds in the soil.

## Subdirectories

### `childrens-ethics-show/`

**"Little Kant"** — A children's ethics show in development.

Teaching philosophical concepts to young minds through stories, characters, and gentle provocations. Making ethics accessible without dumbing it down.

### `youtube-channel/`

**Channel Strategy & Analysis** — Thinking through what a kgents-adjacent YouTube presence might look like.

Content strategy, audience analysis, format exploration. The slow work of figuring out what's worth saying publicly and how to say it well.

---

## Working Here

These projects follow their own rhythm. No sprints, no deadlines, no PRs required.

The only rule: *"Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy."*

If something here graduates to needing structure, it can move or spawn its own repository. Until then, let it breathe.

*Part of the kgents garden. Tended with care.*
