# Constitutional YouTube Channel Strategy

*A principled framework for launching a coding/creativity/edutainment channel*

> *"The Mirror Test: Does this channel feel like me on my best day?"*

---

## The Seven Principles Applied

This strategy derives from kgents' constitutional principles. Each principle shapes a specific aspect of channel design.

---

## 1. TASTEFUL — Clear, Justified Purpose

> "Each agent serves a clear, justified purpose... Say 'no' more than 'yes'"

### The Purpose Test

Before any video, ask:
- Why does this video need to exist?
- What gap in existing content does it fill?
- Could this topic be handled better by someone else?

If the answer to any is uncertain, **don't make the video**.

### Positioning Opportunities (White Space Analysis)

Based on research, these positions are **underserved**:

| Opportunity | Gap | Why Underserved |
|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| **Formal methods in practice** | No one explains category theory, type theory, or formal verification for practitioners | Academic content is inaccessible; practitioner content is shallow |
| **Meta-commentary on AI tools** | Most AI content is tutorials; few analyze the *philosophy* of AI assistance | Requires both technical depth AND philosophical sophistication |
| **Systems thinking for developers** | How complex software actually works (not tutorials) | Requires deep system access and explanation skill |
| **Developer decision-making** | How to think about tradeoffs, not just what to choose | Theo is closest, but focuses on web dev specifically |

### The Tasteful Position

**Proposed unique position**: "Category theory and formal thinking for working developers who want to level up"

This position is:
- **Justified**: Massive gap between academic and practitioner content
- **Defensible**: Requires both depth and accessibility
- **Personal**: Aligns with kgents' categorical foundation
- **Differentiated**: No direct competition

## 2. CURATED — Quality Over Quantity

> "Quality over quantity: Better to have 10 excellent agents than 100 mediocre ones"

### The CGP Grey Model

CGP Grey proves that **infrequent, evergreen content can outperform frequent content**:
- ~195 videos → 1.2 billion views (6.15M per video average)
- 50-100 hours per 5-minute video
- 30-50 script drafts

### Recommended Approach

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Upload frequency** | 1-2 videos/month | Enables research depth |
| **Video length** | 10-20 minutes | Long enough for depth, short enough for retention |
| **Research time** | 2-4 weeks per topic | Matches academic standard |
| **Script drafts** | 10+ minimum | Iteration > inspiration |

### The Curation Discipline

- **Kill your darlings**: Remove any video that doesn't meet quality bar
- **Evergreen first**: Prioritize topics that will be relevant in 5 years
- **Series over one-offs**: Build interconnected content that rewards loyalty

## 3. ETHICAL — Transparency About Limitations

> "Transparency: Agents are honest about limitations and uncertainty"

### Credibility Architecture

Research shows credibility comes from **demonstrated expertise**, not claimed:

| Signal Type | Example | Application |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Work shipped** | Theo shares decision-making publicly | Show real projects, real tradeoffs |
| **Corrections culture** | Tom Scott's public corrections page | Maintain visible corrections |
| **Expert validation** | Grey gets expert review on drafts | Acknowledge when out of depth |
| **Scope honesty** | "This is my interpretation" disclaimers | Never claim certainty you don't have |

### The Ethical Commitment

1. **Never clickbait**: Legitimate curiosity gaps only
2. **Source everything**: Citations visible in video or description
3. **Acknowledge uncertainty**: "I think" vs "this is"
4. **Update errors publicly**: Corrections in pinned comments or follow-up videos
5. **Disclose sponsorships**: Clear, upfront, no hidden influence

---

## 4. JOY-INDUCING — Delight in Interaction

> "Personality matters... Surprise and serendipity welcome"

### The Personality Stack

Every successful channel has a **distinct voice**:

| Channel | Voice Element | Learning |
|---------|---------------|----------|
| Theo | "Software dev rants, pro tips and shitposts" | Humor + expertise can coexist |
| Tom Scott | Self-deprecating but confident | Humility increases trust |
| PirateSoftware | MS Paint as teaching tool | Low-fi can signal authenticity |
| CGP Grey | Rapid-fire delivery with dry wit | Personality can be in *how* you explain |

### Joy-Inducing Elements to Include

1. **Unexpected connections**: Link disparate topics (category theory → game design)
2. **Visual surprises**: Animations that delight, not just illustrate
3. **Verbal wit**: Wordplay, callbacks, self-aware moments
4. **Easter eggs**: Rewards for rewatching
5. **Community in-jokes**: Build shared language over time

### The Fun Constraint

From Kent's _focus.md: *"Being/having fun is free :)"*

If making the content isn't fun, reconsider the content.

---

## 5. COMPOSABLE — Content That Builds

> "Agents are morphisms in a category; composition is primary"

### The Composability Model

Videos should **compose**—each video is a building block for deeper understanding:

```
Foundations                Applications              Advanced
┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
│ What is a   │    →      │ Monads in   │    →      │ Building    │
│ category?   │           │ real code   │           │ DSLs with   │
└─────────────┘           └─────────────┘           │ free monads │
                                                    └─────────────┘
```

### Playlist Architecture

| Series | Purpose | Composition |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Foundations** | Core concepts (categories, types, proofs) | Each builds on previous |
| **Applications** | Practical use cases | References Foundations |
| **Deep Dives** | Single-topic explorations | Standalone but linkable |
| **Conversations** | Guest discussions | Cross-references other series |

### The Composition Test

Before publishing, ask:
- What videos does this reference?
- What future videos could reference this?
- Can someone understand this standalone AND as part of a series?

---

## 6. HETERARCHICAL — Format Serves Topic

> "Leadership is contextual... Agents may share state without ownership"

### Format Flexibility

**Don't force topics into a fixed format**. Let the topic dictate the approach:

| Topic Type | Optimal Format |
|------------|----------------|
| Conceptual explanation | Animation + narration (CGP Grey style) |
| Opinion/hot take | Webcam + enthusiasm (Theo style) |
| System walkthrough | Screen recording + voiceover |
| Interview/conversation | Two-camera dialogue |
| Demonstration | Live coding or whiteboard |

### The Multi-Format Strategy

Instead of "every video is 15 minutes with animation," allow:
- **Core videos**: Highly produced, 15-20 min, monthly
- **Quick takes**: Lower production, 5-8 min, as-needed
- **Conversations**: Podcast-style, variable length, occasional
- **Shorts**: Clips or mini-explanations, algorithmic discovery

### Heterarchical Publishing

Don't commit to a rigid schedule. Publish when:
1. Content meets quality bar
2. Topic is timely (if time-sensitive)
3. You're excited about it

The schedule serves the content, not vice versa.

---

## 7. GENERATIVE — The Channel Spec

> "Spec is compression; design should generate implementation"

### The One-Sentence Spec

A generative spec for the channel:

> *"A channel where a software practitioner with mathematical depth makes category theory, type theory, and formal methods joyful and practical for working developers."*

From this sentence, one could regenerate:
- Content topics (anything that demonstrates formal thinking practically)
- Visual style (clear, mathematical, but accessible)
- Voice (practitioner, not academic; confident, not condescending)
- Format (explanation-focused, composition-aware)
- Audience (developers who want to go deeper)

### The Regeneration Test

If the channel burned down tomorrow, could you rebuild it from the spec?

If the answer is "yes," the spec is generative.
If the answer is "no," the spec is incomplete.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)

| Action | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Produce 3-5 "pillar" videos | Evergreen, foundational content | Establish quality bar and voice |
| Build visual identity | Logo, thumbnail template, intro/outro | Recognition before scale |
| No schedule commitment | Publish when ready | Quality > consistency early |
| Engage selectively | Reply to substantive comments | Build core audience |

### Phase 2: Expansion (Months 6-12)

| Action | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Increase to ~2/month | Sustainable cadence | More at-bats without burnout |
| Launch companion content | Podcast or Shorts | Algorithmic discovery |
| Refine based on data | Double down on what works | Follow audience signals |
| Community naming | Give audience an identity | Belonging increases retention |

### Phase 3: Sustainability (Year 2+)

| Action | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Diversify revenue | Patreon, courses, sponsors | Independence from ads |
| Consider team | Editor first | Maintain quality while scaling |
| Series expansion | New pillars | Controlled growth |
| Platform diversification | Nebula, own site | Don't depend on YouTube alone |

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Failure Modes

| Risk | Evidence | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Burnout** | Tom Scott's 10-year sabbatical | No rigid schedule; quality gates |
| **Controversy** | PirateSoftware's 90% view decline | Stay in lane; avoid drama |
| **Algorithm dependency** | Single-platform fragility | Multi-platform from start |
| **Quality decay** | Johnny Harris criticism | Research time non-negotiable |
| **Niche ceiling** | Limited audience for formal methods | Practical applications > pure theory |

### The Sustainability Check

Monthly ask:
1. Am I still enjoying this?
2. Is quality maintained or improving?
3. Am I learning from the process?
4. Is this financially sustainable?

If any answer is "no," stop and reassess.

## Success Metrics (Non-Vanity)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Retention %** | >50% at video end | Indicates value delivery |
| **Comments quality** | Substantive discussions | Indicates right audience |
| **Rewatch indicators** | Saves, playlist additions | Indicates evergreen value |
| **Referrals** | Links from other creators | Indicates credibility |
| **Revenue per video** | Increasing over time | Indicates sustainability |

**Not metrics**:
- Subscriber count (vanity)
- View count (easily gamed)
- Upload frequency (leads to burnout)

  ├── Can you sustain quality for 12+ months?
  │     No → Wait until you can
  │     Yes ↓
  │
  ├── Do you have credibility signals ready?
  │     No → Build them first (ship projects, write, contribute)
  │     Yes ↓
  │
  ├── Is making this content genuinely fun?
  │     No → Don't launch (it will show)
  │     Yes ↓
  │
  └── LAUNCH with 3-5 pillar videos ready
```

## Final Filter: The Mirror Test

Before every video, before every decision, before every strategic choice:

> *"Does this feel like me on my best day?"*
>
> *"Is this daring, bold, creative, opinionated—but not gaudy?"*
>
> *"Is this tasteful > feature-complete, joy-inducing > merely functional?"*

If yes: proceed.
If no: reconsider.

*"The persona is a garden, not a museum."*

*Let it grow.*
