# YouTube Channel Launch Recommendations

*Updated with Kent's creative empowerment concept*

---

## TL;DR

### The Concept

**"I learned to ______ with AI"** — A developer uses coding agents to become things he's not: a musician, a children's show writer, a game designer.

### The Position

> "What happens when a developer with no creative training uses AI agents to become a musician, writer, and game designer?"

Why this wins:
- **Unique**: Nobody owns "creative empowerment via agents you built yourself"
- **Outcome-focused**: The creative artifact is the star, not the tool
- **Emotionally resonant**: Transformation narrative (can't → can)
- **Credibly differentiated**: Kent builds the agents, doesn't just use them

### The Model

**Veritasium journey format + CGP Grey quality bar**:
- 1-2 main episodes/month (15-25 minutes)
- Each episode: one creative domain, one real output
- Supporting content: behind-the-scenes, shorts, fails
- Quality over quantity (evergreen > timely)

### The Voice

- **Underdog energy**: "I have no training in this"
- **Practitioner credibility**: "I built the agents"
- **Honest about limits**: "Here's where it failed"
- **Wonder, not hype**: "Look what I made" not "AI is amazing"

## Name Decision

### Top Candidates

| Name | Strength | Weakness |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Kreative Function** | Clever (K + function), ownable, rewards understanding | Opaque at first glance |
| **Kent Creates** | Clear, personal, action-oriented | Generic, doesn't signal method |
| **Kent's Concepts** | Personal, trustworthy | Doesn't signal creative/AI angle |

### Recommendation

**"Kreative Function"** is actually quite distinctive:
- The "K" establishes brand (like kgents)
- "Function" signals code to developers
- Combined signals creative + technical
- Unique, memorable once understood
- Scales beyond Kent if desired later

**Alternative**: If testing shows "Kreative Function" confuses people, fall back to "Kent Creates" — simpler, still personal, action-oriented.

**Action**: Test both names with 10 people from target audience before deciding.

## First 5 Episodes

Based on Kent's examples and maximum demonstration potential:

| # | Title | Creative Domain | Why This Works |
|---|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | **"I Learned to Write a Children's Show"** | Screenwriting + character design | Tangible output (pilot script + visuals), emotionally engaging |
| 2 | **"I Learned to Compose Game Music"** | Interactive audio (Winifred Phillips style) | Technical + creative, demonstrable in video |
| 3 | **"I Learned to Design a Board Game"** | Game design + systems thinking | Physical prototype possible, community playtesting |
| 4 | **"I Learned to Produce a Podcast"** | Audio production + research | Meta (about the channel journey?), practical |
| 5 | **"I Learned to Make a Short Film"** | Screenplay + storyboarding | Cinematic, high production value demo |

### Episode Structure (15-25 minutes)

```
1. THE CHALLENGE (1-2 min)
   "I've never written for children. Can I create a show pitch?"

2. THE PLAN (2-3 min)
   "Here's my agent setup: character agent, plot agent, dialogue agent..."

3. THE STRUGGLE (5-8 min)
   Real attempts, failures, iterations
   "The first output was... educational. In the bad way."

4. THE BREAKTHROUGH (3-5 min)
   The moment it starts working
   Show the actual agent interactions

5. THE OUTPUT (3-5 min)
   Present the creative artifact seriously
   Not "AI made this" but "I made this with AI"

6. THE REFLECTION (2-3 min)
   What did I learn? What's the limit?
   Honest quality assessment vs. traditional craft
```

## Production Stack

### Video

| Function | Tool | Cost |
|----------|------|------|
| Editing | DaVinci Resolve | Free |
| Screen recording | OBS Studio | Free |
| Animation | After Effects or Blender | $22/mo or Free |
| Thumbnails | Canva or Photoshop | Free or $22/mo |

### Audio

| Item | Recommendation | Cost |
|------|---------------|------|
| Microphone | Audio-Technica ATR2100x | ~$100 |
| Music | YouTube Audio Library or Epidemic Sound | Free / $15/mo |
| Recording | Closet or treated room | $0-200 |

### The Agent Stack (Kent's Unique Asset)

The episodes should **show** the agent architecture:
- Visualize the agent composition (kgents diagrams)
- Show actual prompts and outputs (screen recordings)
- Explain the "why" of agent design choices
- This is the differentiator—not just using AI, building it

**Total initial investment**: ~$100-300

---

## Visual Identity

### Thumbnail Strategy

**Template formula**:
```
[Expressive face] + [Creative output preview] + [Bold text: "I LEARNED TO ___"]
```

Example thumbnails:
- Kent looking surprised + children's show character sketch + "WRITE A KIDS SHOW"
- Kent with headphones + waveform/music notation + "COMPOSE GAME MUSIC"

### Color Palette Suggestion

| Color | Use | Hex |
|-------|-----|-----|
| Electric purple | Primary brand | #8B5CF6 |
| Warm orange | Accent/CTAs | #F97316 |
| Off-white | Background | #FAFAFA |
| Charcoal | Text | #1F2937 |

Why: Purple signals creativity + sophistication; orange signals energy + warmth; contrast with typical "tech blue" channels.

### Logo Direction

- The "K" from "Kreative Function" as a stylized mark
- Or: A symbol combining code brackets { } with creative element (brush, note)

---

## Audience Strategy

### Primary: "The Creative-Curious Developer"

**Who they are**:
- Technical skills, no creative training
- Always wanted to make music/write/design
- Felt blocked by "I'm not creative" narrative
- Sees AI as unlock, not threat

**What they want to hear**:
> "You don't need 10,000 hours. Here's another path."

### Secondary: "The Tech-Curious Creative"

**Who they are**:
- Creative aspirations or background
- Intimidated by technical tools
- Interested in AI, doesn't know where to start

**What they want to hear**:
> "AI isn't replacing you—but you can use it to do things you never imagined."

### Tertiary: "The AI-Curious Professional"

**Who they are**:
- Works in tech-adjacent field
- Needs to understand AI capabilities
- Prefers demos over hype

**What they want to hear**:
> "Forget the hype. Here's what AI agents can actually do."

## Channel Description

### First 125 Characters (Critical for SEO)

> "A developer uses AI agents to become a musician, writer, and game designer. No formal training. Just code and curiosity."

### Full Description

```
What happens when a developer with no creative training uses AI agents
to write children's shows, compose game music, and design board games?

I'm Kent. I build coding agents (kgents) and use them to create things
I have no business creating. Each episode: one creative domain, one real
output, honest assessment of what worked and what didn't.

This isn't "AI will replace artists." This is "what can you make
when the gap between idea and execution shrinks?"

New episodes: 1-2 per month (quality > quantity)

## Risk Mitigation

### Known Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| "AI art isn't real art" backlash | Frame as augmentation, not replacement; interview traditional artists |
| Output quality concerns | Be honest about limitations; show failures |
| Burnout from high production | 1-2/month pace; batch production |
| Algorithm changes | Multi-platform from start; build email list |
| "Just another AI channel" perception | Emphasize agent-building, not tool-using |

### The Integrity Line

**Always**:
- Show the human in the loop
- Acknowledge what AI can't do
- Be honest about quality vs. traditional craft
- Celebrate both AI and human creativity

**Never**:
- Claim AI equals trained human craft
- Dismiss the value of traditional training
- Oversell capabilities
- Hide failures

---

## Success Metrics (Non-Vanity)

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Retention** | >50% at video end | Value delivery |
| **Comments quality** | Substantive discussion | Right audience |
| **Creative outputs** | Actually usable quality | Credibility |
| **Agent adoption** | People building from your examples | Real impact |

**Not tracking obsessively**:
- Subscriber count (vanity)
- View count (gameable)
- Upload frequency (burnout risk)

> *"Is this honest about both capabilities and limits?"*

If yes: ship it.
If no: revise until yes.
