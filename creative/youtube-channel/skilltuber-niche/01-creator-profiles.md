## Synthesis: Patterns Across Creators

| Creator | Time Investment | Production Style | Metacognition Focus | Emotional Arc |
|---------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Michelle Khare | 30-90 days | High (50+ crew) | Implicit | Fear → Growth |
| Mike Boyd | 2-20 hours | Low-medium | Explicit (hours) | Frustration → Mastery |
| Andrew Huang | Variable | Medium | Explicit (book) | Constraint → Creation |
| Jazza | Variable | Medium | Implicit | Exploration → Delight |

### What's Missing in All Four

None explicitly frame skill-learning as:
1. **Kindness to self** (learning as self-compassion practice)
2. **Generosity to others** (learning in public as gift)
3. **Metacognitive extraction** (what does THIS skill teach about ALL learning?)
4. **Transfer analysis** (honest about what transfers and what doesn't)

**This is the white space.**
