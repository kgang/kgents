*Mapping the skilltuber concept to kgents principles*

## The Seven Principles Applied

### 1. Tasteful

> "Each agent serves a clear, justified purpose. Say 'no' more than 'yes.'"

**Application to Channel:**

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Only skills that teach something about learning | Skills just because they're trendy |
| Skills that allow metacognitive extraction | Skills that are pure entertainment |
| Skills where the process reveals principles | Skills where only outcome matters |

**The Test**: Before each video, ask:
1. What does learning THIS skill teach about learning ANYTHING?
2. What metacognitive lesson can be extracted and named?
3. Will viewers learn something transferable?

If the answer to any is "nothing specific," don't make the video.

---

### 2. Curated

> "Quality over quantity. Every agent earns its place."

**Application to Channel:**

- **Fewer skills, deeper exploration**: Not "52 skills in 52 weeks" but "12 skills, 12 metacognitive lessons"
- **Kill your darlings**: Remove videos that don't meet the metacognition bar
- **Evolve, don't accumulate**: Skills should build on previous lessons

**Anti-patterns to Avoid:**
- "I tried everything" content sprawl
- Skill collection as achievement
- Content for content's sake

---

### 3. Ethical

> "Agents augment human capability, never replace judgment. Transparency about limitations."

**Application to Channel:**

| Transparency Required | Why It Matters |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Honest about transfer** | "This skill's metacognitive lesson transfers; the skill itself probably doesn't" |
| **Honest about editing** | "I compressed 50 hours into 20 minutes—here's what I cut" |
| **Honest about failure** | Real setbacks, not manufactured drama |
| **Honest about limitations** | "I'm not an expert—I'm learning publicly" |

**The Ethical Stance:**
- Don't claim mastery
- Don't promise shortcuts that don't exist
- Don't hide the struggle
- Don't frame learning as productivity optimization (anti-hustle)

---

### 4. Joy-Inducing

> "Delight in interaction. Surprise and serendipity welcome."

**Application to Channel:**

**Where Joy Lives:**
- The "aha" moment when a metacognitive principle clicks
- Unexpected connections between disparate skills
- The playfulness of learning without stakes
- The delight of generosity (sharing what you've learned)

**The Joy Stack:**
```
Primary: Insight joy ("I understand something new about learning!")
Secondary: Vicarious accomplishment ("They did it!")
Tertiary: Entertainment value ("This is fun to watch")
```

**From _focus.md:**
> "Being/having fun is free :)"

If making the content isn't fun, reconsider the content.

---

### 5. Composable

> "Agents are morphisms in a category; composition is primary."

**Application to Channel:**

**Videos Should Compose:**

```
Video 1: Learning juggling → Metacognitive lesson: "Chunking"
Video 2: Learning cooking → Metacognitive lesson: "Feedback loops"
Video 3: Learning music → Metacognitive lesson: "Deliberate practice"
        ↓
Synthesis Video: "The three principles that accelerate any skill"
```

**Building Metacognitive Vocabulary:**
- Each video introduces and names a concept
- Later videos can reference earlier concepts
- Viewers build a mental toolkit over time

**The Composition Test:**
- What previous videos does this reference?
- What future videos could reference this?
- Does this standalone AND work as part of the series?

---

### 6. Heterarchical

> "Agents exist in flux, not fixed hierarchy. Leadership is contextual."

**Application to Channel:**

**The Learning/Teaching Flux:**
- In each video, Kent is the learner
- In the metacognitive extraction, Kent becomes teacher
- Viewers are learners who may teach others
- No fixed hierarchy of expertise

**Format Flexibility:**
- Let the skill dictate the format, not the other way around
- Some skills need documentary treatment
- Some need rapid-fire demonstration
- Some need conversation with experts

**Community Heterarchy:**
- Viewers suggest skills
- Viewers share their own metacognitive extractions
- Learning flows in all directions

---

### 7. Generative

> "Spec is compression; design should generate implementation."

**The Channel Spec:**

> "A channel where a developer learns new skills not to prove accomplishment, but to discover what each skill teaches about how to learn and how to be generous with that knowledge."

**From This Spec, Generate:**

| Element | Generated From Spec |
|---------|---------------------|
| **Content topics** | Any skill that reveals metacognitive principles |
| **Visual style** | Developer-authentic, not over-produced |
| **Voice** | Curious learner, honest about struggle, generous with insights |
| **Format** | Process documentation with metacognitive extraction |
| **Audience** | Anyone who wants to become a better learner |

**The Regeneration Test:**
If the channel burned down, could you rebuild it from this spec? Yes.

---

## Alignment with Meta-Principles

### The Accursed Share

> "Everything is slop or comes from slop. We cherish and express gratitude."

**Application:**
- Failed attempts are not waste—they're compost for learning
- "Slop" footage (the boring parts, the mistakes) reveals real process
- Gratitude for the struggle itself, not just the outcome

### No View From Nowhere

> "To observe is to act. There is no neutral reading."

**Application:**
- Kent's developer background shapes how he learns and what he notices
- Different viewers will extract different metacognitive lessons
- The same skill teaches different people different things

### Personality Space

> "LLMs swim in personality-emotion manifolds. This is not a bug."

**Application:**
- The channel has a personality: curious, generous, honest, playful
- Not "neutral education" but "Kent learning"
- Joy and warmth are features, not overhead

---

## From Persona Spec (spec/k-gent/persona.md)

### Relevant Persona Elements

```yaml
preferences:
  communication:
    style: "direct but warm"
    length: "concise preferred"
  values:
    - "intellectual honesty"
    - "ethical technology"
    - "joy in creation"
    - "composability"
  patterns:
    thinking:
      - "starts from first principles"
      - "asks 'what would falsify this?'"
      - "seeks composable abstractions"
```

### Applied to Channel Voice

| Persona Element | Channel Manifestation |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Direct but warm | Clear metacognitive lessons, friendly delivery |
| Joy in creation | Visible delight in learning process |
| First principles | "What is the core principle here?" |
| "What would falsify this?" | "When would this metacognitive lesson NOT apply?" |
| Composable abstractions | Named, reusable metacognitive concepts |

---

## From Emergence Spec (spec/agents/emergence.md)

### The Sheaf Model Applied

**Local Sections** = Individual skill learning videos
**Gluing** = Synthesis of metacognitive principles across skills
**Emergent Global Behavior** = A viewer becomes a better learner at ANYTHING

```
Local: Juggling video → Chunking lesson
Local: Cooking video → Feedback loops lesson
Local: Music video → Deliberate practice lesson
        ↓
Global (Glued): Metacognitive toolkit that applies everywhere
```

**The Emergence:**
No single video teaches "how to learn anything."
But the **glued collection** does.

---

## Summary: Channel as Principled System

| Principle | Filter Question |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Tasteful** | Does this skill teach something about learning? |
| **Curated** | Is this earning its place in the series? |
| **Ethical** | Am I being honest about what transfers? |
| **Joy-Inducing** | Is this delightful to make and watch? |
| **Composable** | Does this build on and enable other videos? |
| **Heterarchical** | Am I allowing learning to flow all directions? |
| **Generative** | Can this be regenerated from the core spec? |

**If "no" to any principle**: Reconsider.

*"The Mirror Test: Does this channel feel like me on my best day?"*
*"Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy"*
*"Tasteful > feature-complete; Joy-inducing > merely functional"*
