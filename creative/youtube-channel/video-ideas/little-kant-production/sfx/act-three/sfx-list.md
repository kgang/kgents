| 7:00 | Train wheels on track (constant) | Freesound: "train wheels rhythmic" | Background tension |
| 8:00 | Train accelerating | Freesound: "train wheels speeding up" | Final approach |
| 8:05 | Sudden stop silence | **Hard cut to nothing** | No fade - instant |

## Custom SFX: Metal Grinding Heartbeat (5:40)

Layer these elements for the rhythmic industrial pulse:

1. **Slow metal scrape** - pitched to ~60 BPM
2. **Heartbeat** - organic, human, mixed low
3. **Steam rhythms** - synced to beat
4. **Low industrial drone** - constant underneath

This should feel like the space itself has a pulse. Not literal heartbeat - abstracted through metal.

## Mixing Notes for This Scene

- Start industrial ambience at -18dB, slowly raise to -12dB as tension builds
- Train should enter at -24dB (barely audible), build to -6dB at peak
- The hard cut to silence is CRITICAL - do not fade
- Post-silence tinnitus at -18dB, subtle
- Voices in this scene need slight reverb to place them "in the space"
