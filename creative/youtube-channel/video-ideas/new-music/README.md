# New Music: Building Sound from First Principles

> *"I didn't learn music. I derived it."*

---

## The Premise

Most people learn music by consuming it—lessons, tutorials, copying what exists. I went the other way: **build the entire stack from scratch**, then see what emerges.

No presets. No DAW templates. No borrowed theory. Just signal → intention.

## The Stack (Bottom to Top)

| Layer | What I Built | Why It Matters |
|-------|--------------|----------------|
| **Signal** | Digital synthesizer from scratch | Understand what sound *is* |
| **Timbre** | Sound design + mixing fundamentals | Shape the raw material |
| **Tools** | Custom audio/mixing software | No black boxes |
| **Pitch** | Just intonation system | Harmony from physics, not convention |
| **Harmony** | Derived harmonic transitions | Chord progressions I can *justify* |
| **Melody** | Original melodic composition | Expression, not imitation |
| **Structure** | Principled beat breakdowns | Every choice traceable to intent |

## The Arc (Video Structure)

**Cold Open**: Play the finished track. Then: *"I made every part of this from scratch—including the instrument."*

**Act I — Signal**: What is sound? Building a synthesizer to find out.

**Act II — Tuning**: Why does Western music sound the way it does? Deriving just intonation. The lie of equal temperament.

**Act III — Harmony**: Chord progressions aren't magic. They're physics + culture. Here's how I derived my own.

**Act IV — Composition**: With all the pieces understood, what do I *want* to say?

**Resolution**: The track again. Now you hear what I hear.

## The Hook

This isn't "how to make music." It's **what music actually is** when you strip away every layer of abstraction and build it back up with intention.

For people who:
- Wonder why certain sounds feel certain ways
- Are tired of "just use this preset"
- Want to understand, not just operate

## Tone

Daring but not pretentious. Technical but accessible. The vibe: *"I went down this rabbit hole so you don't have to—but now you can if you want."*

## Open Questions

- [ ] Single long-form video or series?
- [ ] Show the software I wrote? (differentiator, but adds complexity)
- [ ] Live performance of the track at the end?
- [ ] Include the "failures"—the bad sounds, the wrong math?

*"The proof is in the signal."*
