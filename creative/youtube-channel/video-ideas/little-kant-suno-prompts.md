# Little Kant: Suno AI Music Prompt List
## Pilot Episode — "A Life (Well) Lived"

---

**Production Notes**

This document contains production-ready Suno AI prompts for the 11-minute Little Kant pilot. Each cue is designed to support the show's distinctive tone: *philosophical without being academic, funny without being silly, strange without being scary*.

**How to Use These Prompts:**
1. Copy the prompt exactly as written (Suno responds well to specific, detailed prompts)
2. Generate 2-3 variations of each cue
3. Select the one that best matches the emotional beat
4. Use the "Instrumental" toggle for all cues (no vocals)

**Master Tonal Guidelines:**
- Understated over dramatic
- European art film over Hollywood
- Precise over lush
- Curious over menacing
- Warmth earned, not given

---

## CUE 1: COLD OPEN / DEPARTURE
**Scene:** Kant leaving Germany (0:00-1:00)
**Emotional Arc:** Melancholy, precision, a life being left behind

### Primary Prompt
```
Minimalist piano composition, European art film aesthetic, melancholic but restrained,
sparse notes with long silences between phrases, subtle ambient pads underneath,
Germanic precision, no sentimentality, 55-60 BPM, solo piano with occasional
low synth drone, Haneke or Trier film score influence, introspective,
the sound of someone leaving home forever but not crying about it
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No drums, no percussion, no swelling crescendos, no major key resolution,
no Hollywood emotional manipulation, no strings, no warm or cozy feeling,
not sad in a comfortable way, no Einaudi-style prettiness
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 60 seconds |
| **Type** | Discrete piece (not looping) |
| **Key** | Minor or modal |
| **Dynamics** | Very quiet, never above mf |
| **Instrumentation** | Solo piano, subtle low-frequency synth pad |

### Usage Note
This cue should feel like watching someone leave through a window you can't open. The precision of the piano mirrors Kant's character—each note placed exactly where it needs to be.

---

## CUE 2: TITLE CARD
**Scene:** "Little Kant" title appears (1:00-1:15)
**Emotional Arc:** A single, clean moment of arrival

### Primary Prompt
```
Single sustained tone, tuning fork resonance, clean and pure,
crystalline piano note with long decay, minimal ambient hum underneath,
the sonic equivalent of a period at the end of a sentence,
one perfect moment, no development, just existence, still and centered
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No melody, no chord progression, no fanfare, no theme song energy,
no drama, no buildup, no resolution, not catchy, not memorable in a jingle way
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 10-15 seconds |
| **Type** | Discrete sting |
| **Key** | Single note (suggest A440 or C) |
| **Dynamics** | Medium, clear, not loud |
| **Instrumentation** | Tuning fork tone, subtle synth undertone |

### Usage Note
This is NOT a theme song. It's a breath. A reset. The audience should feel the space between the cold open and the story proper.

---

## CUE 3: SCHOOL ARRIVAL
**Scene:** Kant arrives at Queens high school (1:15-2:00)
**Emotional Arc:** American chaos filtered through an outsider's ears

### Primary Prompt
```
Indie film score, observational not participatory, American high school
through European eyes, muted guitar picking over light electronic texture,
not cool or hip but curious, anthropological distance,
Wes Anderson meets Jim Jarmusch, warm but detached, 70 BPM,
lo-fi quality, the sound of watching but not belonging
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No pop music, no teen movie energy, no coolness or hipness,
no upbeat or exciting feeling, no John Hughes sentimentality,
no synth-pop, no dance beats, not energetic, not youthful in a marketable way
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 45 seconds |
| **Type** | Bed (can loop for flexibility) |
| **Key** | Major with minor inflections |
| **Dynamics** | Quiet, observational |
| **Instrumentation** | Muted guitar, light electronic texture, possible glockenspiel |

### Usage Note
This cue represents the OBSERVER position. Kant isn't scared or excited—he's watching. The music should sound like someone taking notes on an alien species.

---

## CUE 4: PARKING LOT / THE VAN
**Scene:** Diogenes, Carol, and Kant find each other (2:00-4:00)
**Emotional Arc:** Misfits recognizing each other, understated cool

### Primary Prompt
```
Indie film underscore, afternoon sunlight warmth, comfortable outsider energy,
slack acoustic guitar with subtle lo-fi treatment, unhurried,
the sound of not trying to impress anyone, 68 BPM,
slight Americana influence but not country, muted and comfortable,
sitting on a van roof watching the world, coolness through opting out,
magnetic not quirky, understated friendship forming
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No quirkiness, no whimsy, no cute misfits energy, no ukulele,
no handclaps, no whistling, not twee or precious,
not trying to be charming, no Juno soundtrack energy,
no obvious "these are the cool weird kids" signaling
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 2 minutes (generate 2:30 to allow for cutting) |
| **Type** | Bed (looping) |
| **Key** | Major, open feeling |
| **Dynamics** | Low-medium, comfortable |
| **Instrumentation** | Acoustic guitar (slightly muted), bass, subtle percussion, warm synth pad |

### Usage Note
This is the "home base" sound of the show. The van, the misfits, the opt-out energy. Should feel lived-in, not designed. These kids are cool because they don't care about being cool.

---

## CUE 5: DEMON APPEARANCE
**Scene:** Reality shifts, the Evil Demon appears (4:00-5:30)
**Emotional Arc:** Uncanny, reality questioning itself, curious not menacing

### Primary Prompt
```
Dark ambient soundscape, reality glitching, uncanny valley audio,
layered drones that shift in and out of phase, not horror but unsettling,
philosophical unease, reversed sounds, subtle granular synthesis,
the feeling of a question you can't answer, 40 BPM or less,
Descartes' evil demon as curious investigator not monster,
fluorescent lights flickering as music, clinical observation,
space between thoughts where doubt lives
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No jump scares, no horror movie tension, no menace, no evil sounds,
no demonic voice samples, no scary strings, no building dread,
not a villain theme, not threatening, no horror soundtrack tropes,
no sudden loud moments, no obvious creepiness
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 90 seconds |
| **Type** | Discrete piece with possible loop section |
| **Key** | Atonal/modal, unresolved |
| **Dynamics** | Very quiet, almost subliminal |
| **Instrumentation** | Layered synth drones, reversed piano, granular textures, subtle glitch elements |

### Usage Note
The Demon is NOT a villain. It's a mirror. The music should feel like the moment before you ask yourself a question you've been avoiding. Curious. Patient. Slightly uncomfortable—but not scary.

---

## CUE 6: THE GRIEF ENGINE / PHILOSOPHY SPACE
**Scene:** The trolley problem made real (5:30-9:15)
**Emotional Arc:** Industrial, mechanical heartbeat, ethical weight, the pressure of choosing

### Primary Prompt
```
Industrial ambient, mechanical heartbeat rhythm, ethical weight as sound,
80 BPM (like a stressed heart rate), metallic textures,
steam and iron atmosphere, Victorian industrial revolution as soundscape,
relentless but not aggressive, the sound of a machine that won't stop,
train rhythm underneath, philosophical pressure not action movie tension,
Kant's categorical imperative as mechanical law, cold but not evil,
the greater good as grinding gears
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No action movie tension, no thriller drums, no suspense cues,
no ticking clock sounds, no countdown energy, not exciting,
no Hans Zimmer influence, no triumph or resolution,
no clear good/evil musical coding
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 3:45 (generate 4:00 to allow for cutting) |
| **Type** | Extended bed with development sections |
| **Key** | Modal/industrial, no clear tonal center |
| **Dynamics** | Builds slowly from quiet to medium, never peaks |
| **Instrumentation** | Industrial percussion, metallic textures, steam sounds, heartbeat bass, subtle train rhythm |

### Sub-cues Within This Section

**6A: Setup (5:30-6:30)** — Establishing the space, quiet industrial
```
Quiet industrial ambient, steam and echo, cold empty space,
the sound of a place that shouldn't exist,
factory at night, hollow and waiting
```

**6B: The Tracks (6:30-8:00)** — Pressure building, the heartbeat accelerates
```
Industrial heartbeat rhythm intensifying, 80 BPM rising to 90,
mechanical pulse, the sound of a choice approaching,
train in the distance getting closer, ethical weight pressing down
```

**6C: The Choice (8:00-9:15)** — Maximum tension, then sudden stop
```
Full industrial pressure, all elements present,
climax without catharsis, the sound of refusing to choose,
and then: absolute silence. Complete stop. Nothing.
```

### Usage Note
This extended cue is the heart of the episode. It should feel like the mechanism of ethics itself—impersonal, relentless, but not evil. The Grief Engine isn't punishing anyone; it's just operating according to its nature. The music should make the audience feel the weight of the decision without telling them what to feel about it.

## CUE 7: RESOLUTION / RETURN TO NORMAL
**Scene:** Back in the hallway, reality restored (9:15-10:30)
**Emotional Arc:** Relief, normalcy returning, the strange becoming ordinary again

### Primary Prompt
```
Return to warmth after cold, relief without triumph,
gentle indie underscore, the sound of normal feeling strange,
acoustic guitar returning from earlier but now feels earned,
post-trauma peace not celebration, 65 BPM,
subtle electronic elements grounding us back to reality,
aftermath atmosphere, quiet processing,
the way light looks after you've been in the dark
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No victory music, no resolution fanfare, no "everything's okay now" energy,
not triumphant, not relieved in an obvious way,
no major key brightness, no emotional release,
no Hollywood "we made it" moment
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 75 seconds |
| **Type** | Bed transitioning to discrete ending |
| **Key** | Major with unresolved moments |
| **Dynamics** | Quiet, gradually warming |
| **Instrumentation** | Acoustic guitar, subtle synth, ambient texture, possible return of piano motif |

### Usage Note
This cue is the "coming back down." The audience has been through something intense. Don't rush them. Let them breathe. The music should feel like stepping outside after being in a loud room—your ears are still ringing, but it's quiet now.

---

## CUE 8: TAG / SUNSET
**Scene:** The three on the van roof, friendship beginning (10:30-11:00)
**Emotional Arc:** Warmth, hope, something starting, earned connection

### Primary Prompt
```
Sunset warmth, indie film closing, friendship as sound,
open acoustic guitar with subtle ambient texture,
hopeful but not sentimental, understated joy,
the beginning of something good, 65 BPM,
golden hour light as music, not the end but the start,
lo-fi warmth, misfits together, comfortable silence between notes,
the sound of people who just met but will know each other forever
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No cheese, no obvious emotional manipulation,
not a happy ending theme, no swelling strings,
no "and they all lived happily" energy,
not cute or precious, no quirky friendship music,
no obvious "these are the main characters" theme
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 30-45 seconds |
| **Type** | Discrete closing piece |
| **Key** | Major, open, resolved but not closed |
| **Dynamics** | Warm medium, fades naturally |
| **Instrumentation** | Acoustic guitar, ambient pad, possible subtle bass, open texture |

### Usage Note
This is the promise of the series. Not the theme song—the feeling you have when you know you've found your people. The joke lands, they laugh, the music holds them. Don't oversell it. The understatement IS the power.

---

## CUE 9: POST-CREDITS STING
**Scene:** "Subject identified. Tag him." (5 seconds after credits)
**Emotional Arc:** Ominous, clinical, something watching

### Primary Prompt
```
Clinical sting, office fluorescent hum, surveillance as sound,
5 second burst of controlled menace,
file folder closing as sonic event,
bureaucratic evil, not monster evil,
the scariest sound is someone taking notes about you,
institutional coldness, Hannah Arendt's banality of evil as a sting
```

### Negative Prompt (What to Avoid)
```
No dramatic reveal, no villain theme, no horror movie sting,
not a jump scare, not obviously scary,
no "dun dun DUN" energy, no brass or timpani,
not melodramatic
```

### Production Notes
| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Duration** | 5 seconds exactly |
| **Type** | Sting (non-looping) |
| **Key** | Atonal or minor |
| **Dynamics** | Medium-quiet, clinical |
| **Instrumentation** | Subtle synth, possible tape hiss, fluorescent hum, single tone |

### Usage Note
This is the hook for season 1. Someone is watching. The music should feel like a file being opened, a note being made, a decision being recorded. Not scary—worse. Bureaucratic.

## PRODUCTION WORKFLOW

### Generation Order
1. Start with Cue 4 (Parking Lot) — this establishes the show's "home" sound
2. Generate Cue 6 (Grief Engine) — the longest and most complex
3. Generate Cue 1 (Cold Open) — sets the European tone
4. Generate remaining cues in order

### Quality Control Checklist
- [ ] No cue feels "too Hollywood"
- [ ] No cue has obvious emotional manipulation
- [ ] Each cue could plausibly be from a European art film
- [ ] The industrial sections feel mechanical, not scary
- [ ] The warm sections feel earned, not given
- [ ] Nothing is quirky or whimsical
- [ ] The Demon section feels curious, not menacing

### Suno Settings Recommendations
| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Duration** | Set to match each cue's required length |
| **Mode** | Instrumental (always) |
| **Quality** | High |
| **Variations** | Generate 2-3 per cue |

### Mixing Notes for Final Production
- All music should sit UNDER dialogue, not compete
- Target levels: -18 to -24 dB under speech
- The Grief Engine section can come up slightly during non-dialogue moments
- Quick fade-ins work better than slow builds for most cues
- The Title Card sting should have 2-second tails on both ends

**Philosophy of Sound for Little Kant:**

*"The music should feel like someone thinking, not someone feeling. When it gets warm, the warmth is earned through precision, not manipulation. When it gets strange, the strangeness is curious, not scary. Every note should feel placed, not poured."*
