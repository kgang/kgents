## CREATIVE DIRECTIVE

**The characters are misfits by CHOICE, not by awkwardness.** They're the cool ones who opted out. The audience should want to BE them, not feel sorry for them. Less explaining, more doing. Less philosophy seminar, more magnetic energy.

## COLD OPEN (0:00-1:00)

### SCENE 0: Departure

*Königsberg. Dawn.*

No dialogue. Just images:

- Kant's room. Obsessively organized. Books by size. A clock on every surface.
- His hand adjusting a pen. Millimeters. Perfect.
- His mother in the doorway. She doesn't enter. He doesn't turn.
- A suitcase by the door. Tags: JFK.
- Airplane ascending. Clouds.
- His face in the window. Unreadable.

**Tone**: Cold. Precise. Something is being left behind.

---

## TITLE CARD (1:00-1:15)

**"LITTLE KANT"**

Black. White text. No animation. Clean.

---

## ACT ONE: THE ARRIVAL (1:15-4:00)

### SCENE 1A: Outside the School (1:15-2:00)

*Jefferson High. Queens. Morning chaos.*

Kant walks through the crowd. Doesn't try to fit in. Doesn't try to stand out. Just... walks.

People move around him. He's a rock in a stream.

A JOCK makes eye contact, gives a neutral nod. Kant returns it. Nothing more.

No voiceover. No grid overlay. Just a kid, out of place, not panicking about it.

He checks his schedule. Looks at the building. Walks in.

---

### SCENE 1B: Finding the Misfits (2:00-4:00)

*Location: The parking lot, edge of campus. Lunch period.*

**THE REWRITE: Cool, not corny. Magnetic, not precious.**

---

Kant eats lunch alone on a bench. Reading. Fine with it.

Across the lot: a rusted van. Someone's sitting on the roof.

**DIOGENES** (16) is up there, shirtless, eating an apple, watching the school like it's a nature documentary. A flashlight hangs from their belt loop—visible but unexplained.

Kant notices. Goes back to his book.

A minute later, **CAROL** (15) walks past Kant's bench. She's carrying a notebook covered in dense handwriting. Headed toward the van.

She glances at Kant. He's reading Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. In German.

She keeps walking. But there's a flicker—she clocked him.

---

*At the van:*

Carol climbs up. Sits next to Diogenes. They don't greet each other. Don't need to.

```
DIOGENES: (still watching the school) The lacrosse guys are fighting again.

CAROL: Which ones?

DIOGENES: Does it matter?

CAROL: (considers) Not really.

Silence. They watch. Kant's visible in the distance, still reading.

DIOGENES: New kid.

CAROL: German.

DIOGENES: How do you know?

CAROL: The book. The posture. The way he's not trying to look busy.

DIOGENES: (interested now) He's just sitting there. Reading.

CAROL: Yeah.

DIOGENES: That's kind of tight.

Beat.

CAROL: Should we—

DIOGENES: Nah. If he's one of us, he'll find us.

CAROL: And if he's not?

DIOGENES: Then he won't.

They go back to watching. The scene could end here. But—
```

---

*Five minutes later:*

Kant finishes his chapter. Looks up. Notices the van for the first time—really notices it. The kid on the roof. The girl next to him. The fact that nobody else is anywhere near them.

He makes a decision.

Gets up. Walks over. Not nervous. Not eager. Just... going.

```
Kant approaches the van. Stops at the bumper.

DIOGENES: (not looking down) You need something?

KANT: No.

DIOGENES: Then why are you here?

KANT: (honest) I don't know yet.

Diogenes finally looks down. Studies him.

DIOGENES: You're not scared of us.

KANT: Should I be?

DIOGENES: (to Carol) He's not scared of us.

CAROL: I noticed.

DIOGENES: (to Kant) Most people don't come over.

KANT: I'm not most people.

CAROL: (dry) Obviously.

Silence. Kant stands there. They sit there. Nobody's performing anything.

DIOGENES: You gonna stand there?

KANT: Is there somewhere else to sit?

Diogenes gestures vaguely. There's a crate near the van. Kant sits on it.

They don't talk. They just... exist in the same space. Watching the school.

After a beat:

CAROL: What were you reading?

KANT: Kant.

CAROL: (no reaction) Any good?

KANT: (considers) He's very certain about things.

DIOGENES: (snorts) Is that good or bad?

KANT: I haven't decided.

Nothing more. The bell rings. Distant.

DIOGENES: We stay through sixth period. It's a free.

That's not an invitation. It's information. Kant can do what he wants with it.

KANT: (getting up) I have class.

CAROL: Tomorrow, then.

KANT: Maybe.

He walks away. Doesn't look back.

DIOGENES: (watching him go) He'll be back.

CAROL: Yeah.

DIOGENES: How do you know?

CAROL: (shrugs) He sat down.
```

---

**What's different:**

1. **Less dialogue, more presence.** They're not EXPLAINING themselves—they're just existing.
2. **No philosophy seminar.** The conversation is about nothing and everything.
3. **Kant comes to THEM.** He makes the choice. Active, not passive.
4. **No "you're one of us" corniness.** Just: he sat down. That's enough.
5. **Cool through confidence, not quirk.** Diogenes shirtless on a van roof = magnetic, not weird.
6. **The flashlight is unexplained.** It's just THERE. Mysterious.
7. **Nobody's trying too hard.** The scene is almost boring. But you can't look away.

---

## ACT TWO: THE EVIL DEMON APPEARS (4:00-5:30)

### SCENE 2: The Shift

*Hallway. End of day. Empty.*

Kant at his locker. Putting books away.

The lights flicker. He doesn't react. Keeps packing.

```
The hallway is empty. Too empty.

DEMON (O.S.): You made a choice today.

Kant doesn't startle. He turns, slowly.

The DEMON is there. Made of reflections. Mirrors. Not fully solid.

KANT: I sat with some people.

DEMON: Is that what you call it?

KANT: What would you call it?

DEMON: (almost amused) The beginning of something you can't take back.

Kant stares. The Demon stares back.

KANT: What do you want?

DEMON: To show you what you're really choosing.

The hallway STRETCHES. Warps.

DEMON: Everyone thinks about the trolley problem.
       But nobody really CHOOSES.
       Until now.
```

---

## ACT THREE: THE TROLLEY PROBLEM (5:30-9:30)

### SCENE 3A: The Setup (5:30-6:30)

*The space becomes tracks. Industrial. Cold.*

```
THE GRIEF ENGINE emerges from darkness.

Single eye-headlight. Victorian skeleton wrapped in machine.
The cowcatcher is stained. We know what made those stains.
On the side: "GREATER GOOD EXPRESS"

MAIN TRACK: Fifteen students. Popular kids. Conscious. Strapped.

SIDE TRACK: Two students. Diogenes and Carol. Same situation.

The lever stands between.

DEMON: Fifteen. Or two.
       You know the math.
       What's the answer?

KANT: (looking at the tracks) There's no right answer.

DEMON: There's always an answer. People just don't like admitting it.
```

---

### SCENE 3B: The Tracks (6:30-8:00)

**FROM THE MAIN TRACK:**

```
CHEERLEADER: (not screaming, just clear) Pull the lever.

JOCK: (angry) Fifteen to two. That's not even a question.

ANOTHER KID: (scared) Please. I don't even know them.
```

**FROM THE SIDE TRACK:**

Diogenes and Carol don't beg. They watch.

```
DIOGENES: (to Carol, conversational) This is new.

CAROL: (dry) Yeah.

DIOGENES: (to Kant) You're not gonna pull it.

It's not a question. It's an observation.

KANT: How do you know?

DIOGENES: Because you sat down.

CAROL: (to Diogenes) That doesn't make sense.

DIOGENES: It makes perfect sense.
```

---

### SCENE 3C: The Choice (8:00-9:30)

```
The train moves. Slowly.

DEMON: Clock's ticking.

KANT: (to the Demon) If I pull the lever, I kill them.

DEMON: If you don't, they die.

KANT: There's a difference.

DEMON: Is there?

KANT: (looking at the lever) I didn't create this. You did.
      Whatever happens on that track—the train is killing them. Not me.
      But if I pull this lever—I'm the one who decides who dies.
      I become part of it.

DEMON: That's just philosophy.

KANT: (quiet) It's all I have.

He steps back from the lever.

The fifteen students SCREAM.

The train moves—

—and stops.

Everything freezes. The Demon watches.

DEMON: You'd let fifteen people die for two strangers.

KANT: I'd refuse to kill two people for fifteen strangers.
      It's not the same thing.

DEMON: (long beat) ...Interesting.

The tracks dissolve. Reality flickers back.
```

---

## RESOLUTION (9:30-10:30)

### SCENE 4: The Return

*Back in the hallway. Normal.*

```
Kant is at his locker. Books in hand. Like nothing happened.

He closes the locker. Walks toward the exit.

At the door: Diogenes and Carol. Waiting.

Not for him specifically. They're just... there.

DIOGENES: (seeing him) Oh. You again.

KANT: (flat) Me again.

CAROL: We're going to the van.

It's not an invitation. It's information.

Kant walks with them.

DIOGENES: You look weird.

KANT: I had a strange afternoon.

CAROL: Want to talk about it?

KANT: No.

DIOGENES: (approving) Good answer.
```

---

## TAG (10:30-11:00)

### SCENE 5: The Joke

*The van. Sunset.*

```
The three of them, sitting on the roof now. Watching the empty parking lot.

Silence. Comfortable.

CAROL: You ever think about the trolley problem?

DIOGENES: (groaning) No.

CAROL: (to Kant) You?

KANT: (beat) Sometimes.

CAROL: What would you do?

KANT: (deadpan) Kill you both.

CAROL: ...What?

KANT: Fifteen is greater than two. The math is simple.

They stare at him.

Long beat.

KANT: (tiny smile) That was a joke.

DIOGENES: (exhaling) Jesus.

CAROL: Your delivery is insane.

KANT: I'm working on it.

DIOGENES: (laughing now) Don't. Keep it exactly like that.

They sit. Sun going down. Something has started.

FADE OUT.
```

---

## POST-CREDITS STING (5 seconds)

A file folder. Someone's desk.

**"KANT, I. - SUBJECT IDENTIFIED"**

Other folders visible: **"DIOGENES" / "GILLIGAN, C."**

And more. Many more.

---

## WHAT CHANGED FROM V3

| V3 (Corny) | V4 (Cool) |
|------------|-----------|
| "I'm from Sinope—it's a joke" | Flashlight just hangs there. Unexplained. |
| Philosophy seminar dialogue | Barely any dialogue. Mostly presence. |
| "You're one of us" | "He sat down." |
| Characters explain themselves | Characters just ARE. |
| Kant is passive (stumbles into them) | Kant makes a choice (walks over) |
| Precious, try-hard quirk | Magnetic, understated cool |
| "You'll fit in here" | No explicit welcome. Just: tomorrow, then. |

---

## THE VIBE

**Think:**
- Early Daria (misfits who opted out, not losers who got excluded)
- Atlanta (cool through understatement)
- Fleabag (confidence, dry humor)
- Reservoir Dogs opening (people talking about nothing, but you can't look away)

**Not:**
- Glee (try-hard quirk)
- After-school special (precious lessons)
- Adults writing what they think teens sound like
