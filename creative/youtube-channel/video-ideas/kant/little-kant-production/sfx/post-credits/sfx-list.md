## Tone Notes

This is a STINGER - short, unsettling, setting up future episodes.

- Keep it minimal - less is more
- Office ambience should feel sterile, institutional
- All sounds should be close-mic'd, intimate
- The beep at the end should feel final, like a stamp on a file
- NO music - just sounds and one line of dialogue
- Hard cut to black/silence at the end

The Unknown Voice line: "Subject identified. Tag him."

This should leave the audience with questions, not answers.
