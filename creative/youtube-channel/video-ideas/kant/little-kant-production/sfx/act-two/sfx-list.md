| 4:20 | Lights flickering | Freesound: "fluorescent flicker buzz" | First sign something's wrong |

## Custom SFX: Reality Warp (4:45)

Layer these elements for the reality distortion effect:

1. **Vinyl scratch** - pitched down 50%
2. **Digital glitch/data corruption** - subtle
3. **Reverb swell** - large hall, 100% wet, fade in
4. **Low frequency rumble** - 40-60Hz, subsonic presence
5. **Time stretch artifact** - any sound stretched 400%+

Mix at -6dB, 3-4 second duration. Should feel like reality "skipping" rather than horror jump scare.
