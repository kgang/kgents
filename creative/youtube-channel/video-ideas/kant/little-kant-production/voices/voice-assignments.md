## Voice Direction Notes

Paste these into ElevenLabs "Voice Notes" for each character:

### KANT
```
German teenager, 15 years old. Speaks precisely and deliberately with subtle Germanic cadence.
Pauses 1-2 seconds before responding. Never rushed. Flat affect that warms slightly during rare jokes.
Thoughtful, not robotic. Translating from German in his head.
```

### DIOGENES
```
16 years old, Greek-American. Rough, slightly gravelly voice. Casual about profound things.
Sounds like someone who has nothing to lose. Amused by absurdity. Barking laugh when noted.
Street-wise but not aggressive.
```

### CAROL
```
15 years old, American girl. Warm, therapeutic cadence - therapist's kid energy.
Notices things before speaking. Can shift from gentle to fierce in one line.
Empathetic but not weak.
```

### DEMON
```
Ageless, genderless. Unsettling but not scary. Curious more than cruel.
Speaks with layered quality - one clear voice with whispered undertones.
Patient. Never tells anyone what to do. Just asks questions.
```

### CHEERLEADER
```
Teen girl, clear and direct. Pragmatic. Speaking under duress but holding it together.
```

### JOCK
```
Teen boy, frustrated energy. Angry but scared. Trying to solve the problem through force of will.
```

### ANOTHER KID
```
Teen, scared. Voice trembling. The one who breaks down and begs.
```

### UNKNOWN VOICE (Post-credits)
```
Clinical, detached. Government/organization tone. Reading from a file.
Matter-of-fact about something sinister.
```
