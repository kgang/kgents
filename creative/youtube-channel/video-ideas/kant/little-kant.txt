1. a life (well) lived
  it's the first day of highschool for little kant after
  moving from germany, to queens new york. This is the first time
  he's ever traveled. He's awkward, slightly autistic.

  we see him showing up to the school, but there's a lot
  of pre-established cliques. Even though it's shown that kant
  is talented, he isn't welcomed
  by the nerds or jocks, but he finds a group of misfits

  they chat about the prisoner's dilemma about signing up for 
  easy or hard classes - they talk about the panopticon

  when suddenly there's a large crash - maxwell's demon appears
  kant is thrown into this impossible trolly problem
  all the kids who were mean to him on one side, and the misfits on another

  he chooses not to pull the trigger

  we pull out, and it's his friends proposing the scenario that maxwell's demons
  have concocted this scenario, even going as far as to spell out the exact
  complicating details

  he jokes with them that he'd sacrifice them for sure
