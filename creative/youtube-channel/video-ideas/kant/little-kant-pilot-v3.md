## THE PREMISE

**IMMANUEL KANT** (15), a German transfer student with an obsession for moral consistency, navigates his first day at a Queens high school. He finds his people at the misfit table—**DIOGENES** (16), a kid who lives in a van and carries a flashlight looking for honest people, and **CAROL GILLIGAN** (15), who notices everyone's feelings before they do. When Kant retreats into his own mind to wrestle with a question, the **EVIL DEMON** appears and poses the ultimate test: the trolley problem, with his new friends on the tracks.

## COLD OPEN (0:00-1:00)

### SCENE 0: Departure

*Location: Königsberg/Germany (stylized, not realistic)*

**Beats**:
- Kant's room: obsessively organized. Books by size. Notes by date. A small clock on every surface.
- Morning ritual: Kant follows a precise routine. Coffee at exactly 6:47. Breakfast at 7:02.
- The disruption: He has to leave before completing it. His suitcase is by the door.
- His mother (staying behind) touches his face. He's terrible at goodbyes.
- Final image: Airplane ascending through clouds.

**Tone**: Melancholy, precise, quiet. The silence of leaving everything ordered.

---

## TITLE CARD (1:00-1:15)

**"LITTLE KANT"**

Typography: Germanic weight, sans-serif. The letters arrange themselves into perfect order before settling.

---

## ACT ONE: THE ARRIVAL (1:15-4:00)

### SCENE 1A: Outside the School (1:15-2:30)

*Location: Jefferson High School, Queens. Early morning.*

**The Visual**:
- Everything is BIGGER than Germany. The building, the buses, the chaos.
- A grid overlays Kant's vision—he's categorizing everyone. Jocks. Drama kids. Stoners.
- The grid GLITCHES. There's no category for him.

```
WIDE: Queens high school. Morning chaos. Yellow buses streaming.

KANT (V.O.): In Königsberg, I walked the same route for three years.
             Herr Mueller set his clock by me.

He stands at the edge of the crowd. Small. Still.

CLOSE: His eyes. Tracking movement. Analyzing.

A JOCK passes, not unkind.

JOCK: 'Sup.

KANT: I am arriving for my first day.

JOCK: ...Cool.

The jock walks on. Kant stands alone.

KANT (V.O.): "Sup" is not a question. I checked.
```

---

### SCENE 1B: Finding the Misfits (2:30-4:00)

*Location: A forgotten stairwell, top floor.*

Kant retreats from the hallways. Looking for quiet. He climbs past the populated floors.

At the top: TWO KIDS. Not performing anything.

**DIOGENES** (16) sits on the floor, leaning against a rusted van calendar (their only decoration). Unkempt in a deliberate way. Holding a flashlight, even though it's day.

**CAROL** (15) sits nearby, warm presence, making notes in a web diagram that covers two pages.

```
INT. FORGOTTEN STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Kant reaches the top. Stops.

The two kids look up. They don't startle. They were expecting someone, eventually.

DIOGENES: You're new.

KANT: Yes. From Germany.

DIOGENES: Cool. I'm from Sinope.
          (beat)
          It's a joke. No one gets it.

CAROL: (warm) He lives in a van.

KANT: That is... allowed?

DIOGENES: (shrugging) They gave up trying to tow it.

Kant processes this. Something in him relaxes—just slightly. These are not normal people.

CAROL: I'm Carol. He's Diogenes. It's not his real name but it's the only one he answers to.

KANT: Immanuel Kant. It is my real name.

DIOGENES: German.

KANT: Prussian. Well. It's complicated.

DIOGENES: (genuine interest) Tell me.

Kant blinks. No one's asked him to explain before.

CAROL: Sit. You look like you're running from something.

KANT: I'm not running. I'm... looking for somewhere quiet.

DIOGENES: Same thing. Sit.

He does.
```

**The First Conversation**:

```
They sit in silence. It's not awkward. It's just quiet.

CAROL: (to Diogenes) Where were we?

DIOGENES: You were telling me why I should care about what people think.

CAROL: I wasn't saying that. I was saying you should care about what people FEEL.

DIOGENES: What's the difference?

CAROL: (patient) Thinking is performance. Feeling is underneath. You can ignore opinions. You shouldn't ignore pain.

Kant listens. This is interesting.

KANT: What if ignoring pain now prevents more pain later?

They both look at him.

DIOGENES: (approving) Good question.

CAROL: (studying him) You think about things like that?

KANT: Constantly.

DIOGENES: (grinning) You'll fit in here.

CAROL: (quieter) Or at least you'll have company while you don't.
```

**Button**: The bell rings. But none of them move immediately.

```
The bell rings. Distant. Muffled.

DIOGENES: We should go.

CAROL: (to Kant) Same time tomorrow?

KANT: (surprised) You... want me to come back?

CAROL: (like it's obvious) You're one of us. I could tell when you walked up.

KANT: How?

DIOGENES: (standing, stretching) You didn't try to make us like you. You just sat down.

They head to class. Kant follows. Something has shifted.

KANT (V.O.): In Germany, I walked alone.
             Here... perhaps not.
```

---

## ACT TWO: THE EVIL DEMON APPEARS (4:00-5:30)

### SCENE 2: The Shift

*Location: Hallway, then transforming space*

Kant walks alone after his last class. Replaying the conversation.

```
INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Kant walks. Thinking.

KANT (V.O.): "You shouldn't ignore pain."
             But what if acknowledging pain costs something?
             What if the thing that helps one person hurts another?

He stops. The hallway is empty.

KANT (V.O.): What if... you had to choose?

The fluorescent lights FLICKER.

VOICE (O.S.): An excellent question, Immanuel.

Kant freezes. Looks around.

VOICE: You think about right and wrong constantly.
       But you've never really been TESTED.
       Have you?

The hallway STRETCHES. Lockers warp. Reality becomes unreliable.

THE DEMON coalesces from reflections in the locker mirrors.
Made of fragments. Never fully solid. Never fully there.

DEMON: I'm not here to trick you. Descartes thought that's what I do.
       But Descartes was wrong about many things.
       I'm here to REVEAL you.
       Show you who you really are.
       There's a difference.

KANT: (struggling to stay calm) You're not real.

DEMON: (almost kind) That's exactly what Descartes said.
       And then he spent his whole life trying to prove he existed.
       (beat)
       I have something to show you.
       Something you've been preparing for your whole life.
```

---

## ACT THREE: THE TROLLEY PROBLEM (5:30-9:30)

### SCENE 3A: The Grief Engine Arrives (5:30-7:00)

*Location: The hallway becomes a train yard.*

```
The hallway DISSOLVES. Replaced by TRACKS.

From the distance: a SOUND. Not a horn—a GROAN. Something ancient.

THE GRIEF ENGINE emerges from darkness.

A locomotive from no identifiable era. Victorian skeleton wrapped in industrial nightmare.
Single headlight that functions as an EYE. It sees. It searches.
On the side, faded gold letters: "GREATER GOOD EXPRESS"
The cowcatcher is STAINED. We know what made those stains.

The train STOPS. The eye fixes on Kant.

DEMON: You know what this is.

KANT: The trolley problem.

DEMON: Everyone knows it. Philosophy 101.
       But knowing and CHOOSING are different things.
       Let me make it real.

The Demon gestures. On the tracks:

MAIN TRACK: Fifteen students. Popular kids. The ones from the hallway.
            They're CONSCIOUS. Strapped down. Looking at him.

SIDE TRACK: Two students. Diogenes and Carol.
            Also conscious. Also strapped. Also looking at him.

Between them: THE LEVER. Heavy. Iron. Worn smooth by other hands.

DEMON: The math is simple. Fifteen or two.
       The train is coming.
       The only question is what YOU do.
```

---

### SCENE 3B: The Voices from the Tracks (7:00-8:00)

**FROM THE MAIN TRACK**:

```
JOCK 1: PULL IT! Pull the lever!

CHEERLEADER: Please—I have a family—

JOCK 2: There's FIFTEEN of us! You met them TODAY!

JOCK 3: (crying) We don't even know you. Why would you let us die for strangers?

JOCK 4: JUST PULL IT!
```

**FROM THE SIDE TRACK**:

```
DIOGENES: (almost amused) Well this is interesting.

CAROL: (to Kant, calm) It's okay. Whatever you do... it's okay.

DIOGENES: (to Carol) Is it though?

CAROL: (honest) I don't know. But I think he needs to hear it.

DIOGENES: (to Kant) Don't listen to them. But also...
          (genuinely uncertain)
          Maybe listen to them?

CAROL: (quieter) We see you, Kant. Whatever happens. We see you.
```

---

### SCENE 3C: Kant's Reasoning (8:00-9:00)

```
KANT: (to the Demon) This is a test.

DEMON: Everything is a test. This one happens to involve a train.

Kant looks at the lever. Then at Carol and Diogenes. Then at the fifteen.

KANT: If I pull the lever...
      I redirect the train.
      I CAUSE their deaths.
      (gestures to his friends)
      They become instruments. A means to an end.

DEMON: But you'd be SAVING more—

KANT: I'd be USING them.
      Their lives become currency. A trade.
      I didn't put anyone on these tracks. You did.

JOCK 1: (screaming) THAT'S THE SAME THING! You see the lever! You know what it does!

KANT: (turning to him) No. It isn't.
      The TRAIN is killing you.
      But if I pull that lever—I become the one who kills THEM.
      With my hands. My choice. My action.

DEMON: And if everyone refused to pull the lever?

KANT: Then everyone would refuse.
      And perhaps there would be fewer tracks.
      Fewer impossible choices designed by... whatever you are.

CAROL: (from the tracks, quiet) That's the categorical imperative, isn't it?
       What if everyone did it?

KANT: (surprised she knows) ...Yes.

CAROL: I read.

DIOGENES: (to Carol) You're having a philosophy seminar right now?

CAROL: Seemed relevant.

DIOGENES: (to Kant) She's always like this. You'll get used to it.
```

---

### SCENE 3D: The Choice (9:00-9:30)

```
The train CREEPS forward. The lever GLOWS.

DEMON: (soft, almost curious) You'd really let fifteen people die?
       For two you met today?

KANT: (long beat, then)
      I'm not letting anyone die.
      YOU are killing them.
      The question is whether I participate.
      And I won't.
      I will not become someone who sacrifices his friends for math.
      Not for the "greater good."
      Not for you.

He STEPS BACK from the lever.

The train STOPS. The headlight-eye blinks—confused.

DIOGENES: (from the tracks, genuine surprise) Huh.

CAROL: (very quiet) You chose us.

KANT: I chose not to choose against you.
      There's a difference.

DEMON: (mirrors rippling) ...Interesting.
       René never thought of that.
       None of them did.

The train FADES. The tracks DISSOLVE.
Reality flickers—
```

---

## RESOLUTION (9:30-10:30)

### SCENE 4: The Reveal

*Location: Back to reality—the hallway, normal.*

```
PULL BACK: The hallway is normal. Kant is standing alone.
           Was he just... thinking?

CAROL: (approaching with Diogenes) Hey. You okay? You zoned out.

KANT: (disoriented) ...How long was I standing here?

DIOGENES: Like two seconds? Bell rang.

Kant looks around. Normal school. Normal people.

But—for ONE FRAME—the hallway GLITCHES.
A mirror-reflection shows the Demon's face. Then gone.

CAROL: We're going to the van. You coming?

KANT: ...Yes.

They walk together. Kant glances back at the hallway.

CAROL: You look like you saw something.

KANT: I... may have.

DIOGENES: (matter-of-fact) It happens.

KANT: (stops) What?

DIOGENES: The Demon. The train thing. The impossible choices.
          (shrugs)
          It happens.

CAROL: (gently) We've all seen something. You'll learn to live with it.

KANT: What did you see?

They're quiet. Then:

DIOGENES: I was asked what I'd give up to be free.

CAROL: I was asked who I'd hurt to protect someone.

KANT: And what did you choose?

DIOGENES: (half-smiling) I told it to get out of my sunlight.

CAROL: I didn't answer. I'm still thinking about it.

They walk. Kant is not alone.
```

---

## TAG (10:30-11:00)

### SCENE 5: The Joke

*Location: The van, parking lot.*

```
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

They sit around Diogenes' van. The broken vending machine nearby. A small camp stove heating water.

CAROL: So. First day. Thoughts?

KANT: ...It was not what I expected.

DIOGENES: America rarely is.

KANT: I mean... (struggling) In Germany, I understood the rules. Here—

CAROL: Here the rules don't make sense?

KANT: Here the rules change depending on who you ask.

DIOGENES: (nodding) That's America. Everyone's got their own rules.

KANT: That seems... chaotic.

CAROL: That's why we're here. Trying to figure out which rules actually matter.

Beat. Kant considers this.

KANT: (very seriously) I've been thinking about the trolley problem.

DIOGENES: (groaning) Not again.

CAROL: Let him finish.

KANT: If I had pulled the lever... would you have understood?

Long pause. They look at each other.

DIOGENES: Honestly? Yeah. I'd get it. Fifteen to two.

CAROL: I'd understand. I wouldn't agree. But I'd understand.

KANT: (processing) And you'd still be my friend? If I'd... chosen differently?

CAROL: (gently) You'd still be you. You'd just be a you who made a different choice.

DIOGENES: (practical) And you'd be a you who killed us, so, you know. Points off.

KANT: (deadpan) I see.
      (beat)
      For the record, I've reconsidered.
      The utilitarian calculus is sound.
      Fifteen is greater than two.
      For the greater good, I would sacrifice you both.

They freeze. Stare at him.

KANT: That was a joke.

CAROL: ...Was it?

KANT: (tiny smile) You tell me.

Diogenes BARKS a laugh. Carol shakes her head.

CAROL: Your delivery is terrifying.

KANT: I am learning American humor.

DIOGENES: (handing him tea) You're doing great.

They sit. First day survived. Friends made.

KANT (V.O.): Cogito ergo sum. I think, therefore I am.
             But the question remains:
             What kind of person am I becoming?

             I think I'm learning to find out.

FADE OUT.

END OF EPISODE
```

## POST-CREDITS STING (5 seconds)

The Demon's face in a locker mirror. Watching. Then gone.

A new file appears in an unseen office: **"KANT, I. - SUBJECT IDENTIFIED"**

Other files visible beside it: **"DIOGENES - ACTIVE"** **"GILLIGAN, C. - ACTIVE"**

And many more. Names we'll learn.

---

## WHAT THIS PILOT ESTABLISHES

1. **Kant**: Precise, principled, socially awkward—but not cold. Willing to be misunderstood for his beliefs.

2. **Diogenes**: The kid who lives in a van, carries a flashlight, tells the Demon to leave. Honest to the point of provocation, but surprisingly tender.

3. **Carol**: The one who notices feelings, sees who's left out, asks hard questions gently. Gets fierce when needed.

4. **The Dynamic**: Three misfits who found each other. Each embodies a philosophical tradition without knowing it.

5. **The Evil Demon**: Recurring entity that reveals, not deceives. Has appeared to all of them. They don't talk about it much.

6. **The Tone**: Philosophical without being academic. Funny without being silly. Strange without being scary.

7. **The Mystery**: What are they? Why do they think like this? The show knows. It's not telling.
