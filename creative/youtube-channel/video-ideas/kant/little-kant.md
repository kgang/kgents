# Little Kant
## Series Bible & Pilot Treatment

> *"They're not studying philosophy. They ARE philosophy."*

---

## THE LOGLINE

A German transfer student with an obsession for moral rules finds his people at the misfit table—including a kid who lives in a van and a girl who notices everyone's feelings—and together they navigate high school, an Evil Demon who poses impossible questions, and the discovery that they might be something more than ordinary teenagers.

---

## THE CONCEPT

### What It Is

A coming-of-age series where the main characters unknowingly embody history's greatest philosophical traditions. They don't lecture about ethics—they live it, argue it, struggle with it. The audience learns Kantian ethics by watching Kant navigate whether to report a cheater, not by hearing him explain categorical imperatives.

### What It Isn't

- Not a philosophy lecture with characters attached
- Not "The Good Place but younger" (though there's overlap)
- Not chronological or aging (think Peanuts, The Simpsons)
- Not didactic (the show asks questions, doesn't answer them)

### The Core Insight

Teenagers already think philosophically—they just don't have the vocabulary. They ask "Could everyone do this?" and "What kind of person am I becoming?" and "Who's being left out?" constantly. This show gives them characters who take those questions seriously.

---

## THE FIVE PHILOSOPHERS

> *Each philosopher has a voice, a question, and a signature tension.*

### IMMANUEL KANT (15, he/him)
*"Could everyone do this?"*

**The Anchor**. German transfer student. Working-class background. Lives with an aunt who doesn't understand him. Obsessively moral, genuinely kind, socially awkward in a way that reads as blunt rather than shy.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Core Question** | "Could everyone do this?" |
| **Philosophy** | Deontological ethics—duty over consequence |
| **Signature Move** | Tests every action against universalizability |
| **Voice Note** | Speaks precisely. Doesn't say "I feel like..." Says "I observe that..." Germanic directness reads as blunt. 2-second pause before responses. |
| **Signature Phrases** | "The principle does not bend." / "What you owe is independent of what you feel." / "That is not a reason. That is a rationalization." |
| **Struggle** | When context demands flexibility; when his principles cost him |

**His Arc**: Kant learns that principles need wisdom to apply. He doesn't abandon deontology—he deepens it.

---

### DIOGENES (16, he/they)
*"What do you actually need?"*

**The Provocateur**. Lives in a rusted van in the school parking lot. Parents absent. Radically honest, deliberately minimal, carries a flashlight looking for honest people (and sometimes finds them).

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Core Question** | "What do you actually need?" |
| **Philosophy** | Cynicism (original Greek sense)—strip away convention |
| **Signature Move** | Questions every assumption; does the uncomfortable honest thing |
| **Voice Note** | Rough, barking laugh. Eating sounds when appropriate. Shirtless on van roofs. The flashlight is never explained. |
| **Signature Phrases** | "That's just convention." / "You don't need that. You WANT it." / "I'm looking for an honest person." |
| **Struggle** | When connection is valuable; when radical freedom becomes isolation |

**Their Arc**: Diogenes learns that some connections are worth keeping—that you can reject convention without rejecting people.

---

### CAROL GILLIGAN (15, she/her)
*"What does this relationship need?"*

**The Connector**. Transferred from a school where she was "too intense." Therapist parents. Notices who's being left out before anyone else. Gets fierce when care is ignored.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Core Question** | "Who's being left out of this decision?" |
| **Philosophy** | Care ethics—relationships and context over abstract rules |
| **Signature Move** | Sees the person not being considered; names emotions others can't articulate |
| **Voice Note** | Warm, therapeutic cadence. American. Can go from gentle to fierce in one sentence. |
| **Signature Phrases** | "But what about..." / "Have you asked them how they feel?" / "The rule isn't the point. The person is." |
| **Struggle** | When care becomes enabling; when she neglects herself caring for others |

**Her Arc**: Gilligan learns that care includes caring for herself. She develops boundaries without losing compassion.

---

### ARISTOTLE (16, he/him)
*"What's the balanced path here?"*

**The Moderator**. The golden mean kid. Athlete AND debate club AND garden club. Popular enough to sit elsewhere, chooses the misfits. Always asking "Is that brave or reckless?"

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Core Question** | "What would a person of good character do?" |
| **Philosophy** | Virtue ethics—character and practical wisdom |
| **Signature Move** | Finds the balance point; asks what habit this builds |
| **Voice Note** | Warm Greek cadence. Pacing footsteps in background. Thoughtful pauses. |
| **Signature Phrases** | "The virtue is the balance." / "But what kind of person does that make you?" / "Excellence is not an act but a habit." |
| **Struggle** | When balance is impossible; when forced to choose extremes |

**His Arc**: Aristotle learns that sometimes the balanced path doesn't exist—and you have to choose anyway.

---

### BLAISE PASCAL (15, he/him)
*"What are the odds?"*

**The Anxious Calculator**. Everything is probability and risk. Disappeared once, came back religious. Brilliant at seeing consequences, terrible at accepting uncertainty.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Core Question** | "But what if you're wrong?" |
| **Philosophy** | Probabilistic reasoning meets existential dread |
| **Signature Move** | Calculates expected values; names the uncertainty everyone else ignores |
| **Voice Note** | French-adjacent, thin and nervous. Variable pace—fast when calculating, slow when contemplating infinity. |
| **Signature Phrases** | "The expected value of..." / "But what if you're wrong?" / "The heart has reasons that reason knows not." |
| **Struggle** | Paralysis from too much calculation; the leap of faith |

**His Arc**: Pascal learns that sometimes you have to act without certainty—that's what faith is.

---

## THE PHILOSOPHICAL DYNAMICS

### The Tension Matrix

| Pair | The Tension | What They Teach Each Other |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Kant vs Diogenes** | Rules vs Freedom | Kant shows structure matters; Diogenes shows structure can trap |
| **Kant vs Gilligan** | Duty vs Care | Kant shows principles prevent favoritism; Gilligan shows context matters |
| **Diogenes vs Gilligan** | Freedom vs Connection | Diogenes shows independence; Gilligan shows interdependence |
| **Pascal vs Everyone** | Certainty vs Action | Pascal forces them to face uncertainty; they force him to decide anyway |
| **Aristotle as Moderator** | Extremes vs Balance | Often bridges; but sometimes can't—and that's the episode |

### The Alliances

- **Kant + Aristotle**: Both believe in structure (duty vs virtue), but different grounding
- **Diogenes + Gilligan**: Both critique abstraction (freedom vs care), but different values
- **Pascal + Kant**: Both obsessive systematizers, but Kant finds certainty Pascal can't

---

## THE WORLD

### Jefferson High School, Queens, New York

A large, underfunded public high school. Diverse in every way—race, class, culture, neurotype. The administration is overwhelmed. The teachers range from burned out to heroic. The students form complex tribal hierarchies.

**Why Queens**:
- Most ethnically diverse urban area in the world
- Working-class roots with aspiration
- Kant's fish-out-of-water status makes sense
- Real place, real stakes

### The Misfit Table

A corner of the cafeteria, near the emergency exit and the broken vending machine. Not hidden, but not central. The table finds you when you need it.

### The Parking Lot Van

Diogenes lives in a rusted van that the school has given up trying to tow. It's become a second headquarters—the place for conversations too intense for the cafeteria. Blankets, a camp stove, philosophy books with broken spines. "SINOPE MOVERS" faded on the side.

---

## THE EVIL DEMON

### What It Is

A recurring entity that appears when Kant (or others) face genuine moral dilemmas. Not a villain—a revealer. It doesn't deceive; it strips away the comfortable contexts that make choosing easy.

### How It Works

- Emerges from Kant's own questioning (internal made external)
- Made of mirrors and reflections—shows you yourself
- Poses the dilemma in its purest form
- Never tells anyone what to do
- Watches the choice. That's all.

### Its Relationship to the Cast

- Has appeared to the others (implied, not shown)
- Diogenes claims to have told it to leave ("Get out of my sunlight")
- Gilligan won't repeat what it asked her
- Pascal saw it once and hasn't been the same

### The Grief Engine

A manifestation that appears in the Demon's scenarios—a locomotive called the "Greater Good Express" that literalizes utilitarian calculus. Victorian skeleton, industrial nightmare, stained cowcatcher. **It will return.**

---

## THE TIMELESSNESS

### Characters Don't Age

Like Peanuts or The Simpsons, Little Kant exists in an eternal present. Characters are always 15-16. They never graduate. Summer happens but doesn't advance time.

### But They Change

- Characters have memories of previous episodes
- Growth is real—Kant becomes slightly more flexible, Gilligan learns boundaries
- Relationships deepen, fracture, repair
- The emotional stakes compound

### Episodes Aren't Necessarily Chronological

- An episode might reference something we haven't seen
- Flashbacks aren't labeled
- The audience pieces together the timeline (or doesn't)
- Creates rewatch value and mystery

---

## THE MYSTERY LAYER

### What They Don't Know

The characters don't know they're philosophers. They don't know Kant is quoting Kant. Something strange is happening—reincarnation, echoes, ideas generating people—but the show never explains.

### Easter Eggs

- Kant's aunt lives on Königsberg Street
- Diogenes' van has "SINOPE MOVERS" faded on the side
- Gilligan's notebook says "In a Different Voice" doodled on it
- The school's statue is of someone who looks like John Dewey
- Pascal carries a book called "Pensées" that he's always writing in

### The Long Game

Over multiple seasons, hints accumulate. The Demon knows more than it says. Other "philosophical" kids appear in other cities. There's something larger happening. But it's never the main story—the main story is always the kids, the friendships, the choices.

---

## CORE COMMITMENTS

### We Will Always

1. Show philosophy through behavior, never lecture
2. Let multiple positions have genuine merit
3. Leave questions open
4. Trust the audience
5. Find humor in truth
6. Make the misfits magnetic—cool through opting out, not excluded

### We Will Never

1. Have characters explain their philosophy
2. Resolve dilemmas completely
3. Declare winners in philosophical debates
4. Make the show a delivery mechanism for lessons
5. Let the weird mythology overwhelm the human story
6. Make the outcasts feel sorry for themselves

### The Mirror Test

Before any creative decision, ask:

> "Does this feel like genuine philosophy made dramatic—daring, bold, opinionated, but not preachy?"
>
> "Would teenagers actually watch this?"
>
> "Is the joke also true?"

If yes, proceed. If no, iterate.

---

## VISUAL STYLE

| Element | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| **Overall style** | 2D animation with hand-drawn feel; clean in reality, warped in philosophy-space |
| **Color palette** | Muted European (Kant's internal world) vs. saturated American (external chaos) |
| **Philosophy visualization** | Reality glitches—the medium becomes unreliable when characters think deeply |
| **Evil Demon** | Made of mirror fragments, reflections. Never fully solid. |
| **The Grief Engine** | Victorian skeleton wrapped in industrial nightmare. The eye-headlight. The stained cowcatcher. The ghost-filled cargo cars. |
| **Character design** | Each reflects their philosophy: Kant (geometric, precise), Diogenes (organic, loose), Gilligan (warm colors, circular), Pascal (nervous lines) |

### Reality vs. Philosophy-Space

| Reality | Philosophy-Space |
|---------|------------------|
| Naturalistic lighting | Expressionist, heightened |
| Consistent physics | Space warps to meaning |
| Normal sound design | Sound becomes significant |
| Time flows normally | Time stretches, contracts |

---

## TONE

### What We Are

- Philosophical without being academic
- Funny without being unserious
- Strange without being scary
- Challenging without being preachy

### Comparable Tones

- **Peanuts**: Eternal present, philosophical kids, deadpan humor
- **Daria**: Smart outcasts navigating dumb systems
- **Over the Garden Wall**: Strangeness with emotional depth
- **Atlanta**: Cool through understatement

### The Humor

- Comes from character, not situation comedy
- Deadpan delivery (especially Kant)
- Absurdist moments (especially Diogenes)
- Jokes that land because they're true

---

# PILOT EPISODE: "A Life (Well) Lived"

> *Format: 11 minutes | Target: 12-16 year olds (and their adults)*

---

## WHY THIS TITLE

The parenthetical "(Well)" is the key. The episode asks: What does it mean to live *well*?

- **The Utilitarian Answer**: Maximize good outcomes. Pull the lever. Save the most lives.
- **Kant's Answer**: Live according to principles you can universalize. Don't use people as means.
- **The Third Answer** (the surprise): Know when to stop philosophizing and eat your lunch.

---

## BIOGRAPHICAL GROUNDING (The Real Kant)

| Historical Fact | Character Translation |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Born Königsberg, Prussia; working-class harness-maker father | Working-class immigrant roots; doesn't fit wealthy/prep-school vibe |
| Pietist upbringing (austere, emotionally suppressed) | Struggles with emotional expression; finds refuge in logic |
| Legendary punctuality (neighbors set clocks by his walks) | Rigid about routines; gets anxious when things are out of order |
| "Gifted conversationalist" but withdrew to solitude | Can charm when engaged, but prefers to observe |
| Potentially neurodivergent (speculative but compatible) | Slightly autistic coding—not a diagnosis, a texture |

## MINUTE-BY-MINUTE BREAKDOWN

### COLD OPEN (0:00-1:00)

**SCENE 0: Departure**

*Location*: Königsberg/Germany (stylized, not realistic)

No dialogue. Just images:

- Kant's room: obsessively organized. Books by size. A clock on every surface.
- His hand adjusting a pen. Millimeters. Perfect.
- His mother in the doorway. She doesn't enter. He doesn't turn.
- A suitcase by the door. Tags: JFK.
- Airplane ascending. Clouds.
- His face in the window. Unreadable.

**Tone**: Cold. Precise. Something is being left behind.

---

### TITLE CARD (1:00-1:15)

**"LITTLE KANT"**

Black. White text. No animation. Clean.

---

### ACT 1: THE ARRIVAL (1:15-4:00)

**SCENE 1A: Outside the School (1:15-2:00)**

*Jefferson High. Queens. Morning chaos.*

Kant walks through the crowd. Doesn't try to fit in. Doesn't try to stand out. Just... walks.

People move around him. He's a rock in a stream.

A JOCK makes eye contact, gives a neutral nod. Kant returns it. Nothing more.

No voiceover. No grid overlay. Just a kid, out of place, not panicking about it.

He checks his schedule. Looks at the building. Walks in.

---

**SCENE 1B: Finding the Misfits (2:00-4:00)**

*The parking lot, edge of campus. Lunch period.*

Kant eats lunch alone on a bench. Reading. Fine with it.

Across the lot: a rusted van. Someone's sitting on the roof.

**DIOGENES** (16) is up there, shirtless, eating an apple, watching the school like it's a nature documentary. A flashlight hangs from their belt loop—visible but unexplained.

Kant notices. Goes back to his book.

A minute later, **CAROL** (15) walks past Kant's bench. She's carrying a notebook covered in dense handwriting. Headed toward the van.

She glances at Kant. He's reading Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. In German.

She keeps walking. But there's a flicker—she clocked him.

---

*At the van:*

Carol climbs up. Sits next to Diogenes. They don't greet each other. Don't need to.

```
DIOGENES: (still watching the school) The lacrosse guys are fighting again.

CAROL: Which ones?

DIOGENES: Does it matter?

CAROL: (considers) Not really.

Silence. They watch. Kant's visible in the distance, still reading.

DIOGENES: New kid.

CAROL: German.

DIOGENES: How do you know?

CAROL: The book. The posture. The way he's not trying to look busy.

DIOGENES: (interested now) He's just sitting there. Reading.

CAROL: Yeah.

DIOGENES: That's kind of tight.

Beat.

CAROL: Should we—

DIOGENES: Nah. If he's one of us, he'll find us.

CAROL: And if he's not?

DIOGENES: Then he won't.
```

---

*Five minutes later:*

Kant finishes his chapter. Looks up. Notices the van—really notices it. The kid on the roof. The girl next to him. The fact that nobody else is anywhere near them.

He makes a decision.

Gets up. Walks over. Not nervous. Not eager. Just... going.

```
Kant approaches the van. Stops at the bumper.

DIOGENES: (not looking down) You need something?

KANT: No.

DIOGENES: Then why are you here?

KANT: (honest) I don't know yet.

Diogenes finally looks down. Studies him.

DIOGENES: You're not scared of us.

KANT: Should I be?

DIOGENES: (to Carol) He's not scared of us.

CAROL: I noticed.

DIOGENES: (to Kant) Most people don't come over.

KANT: I'm not most people.

CAROL: (dry) Obviously.

Silence. Kant stands there. They sit there. Nobody's performing anything.

DIOGENES: You gonna stand there?

KANT: Is there somewhere else to sit?

Diogenes gestures vaguely. There's a crate near the van. Kant sits on it.

They don't talk. They just... exist in the same space. Watching the school.

After a beat:

CAROL: What were you reading?

KANT: Kant.

CAROL: (no reaction) Any good?

KANT: (considers) He's very certain about things.

DIOGENES: (snorts) Is that good or bad?

KANT: I haven't decided.

Nothing more. The bell rings. Distant.

DIOGENES: We stay through sixth period. It's a free.

That's not an invitation. It's information. Kant can do what he wants with it.

KANT: (getting up) I have class.

CAROL: Tomorrow, then.

KANT: Maybe.

He walks away. Doesn't look back.

DIOGENES: (watching him go) He'll be back.

CAROL: Yeah.

DIOGENES: How do you know?

CAROL: (shrugs) He sat down.
```

---

### ACT 2: THE EVIL DEMON APPEARS (4:00-5:30)

**SCENE 2: The Shift**

*Hallway. End of day. Empty.*

Kant at his locker. Putting books away.

The lights flicker. He doesn't react. Keeps packing.

```
The hallway is empty. Too empty.

DEMON (O.S.): You made a choice today.

Kant doesn't startle. He turns, slowly.

The DEMON is there. Made of reflections. Mirrors. Not fully solid.

KANT: I sat with some people.

DEMON: Is that what you call it?

KANT: What would you call it?

DEMON: (almost amused) The beginning of something you can't take back.

Kant stares. The Demon stares back.

KANT: What do you want?

DEMON: To show you what you're really choosing.

The hallway STRETCHES. Warps.

DEMON: Everyone thinks about the trolley problem.
       But nobody really CHOOSES.
       Until now.
```

---

### ACT 3: THE TROLLEY PROBLEM (5:30-9:30)

**SCENE 3A: The Setup (5:30-6:30)**

*The space becomes tracks. Industrial. Cold.*

```
THE GRIEF ENGINE emerges from darkness.

Single eye-headlight. Victorian skeleton wrapped in machine.
The cowcatcher is stained. We know what made those stains.
On the side: "GREATER GOOD EXPRESS"

MAIN TRACK: Fifteen students. Popular kids. Conscious. Strapped.

SIDE TRACK: Two students. Diogenes and Carol. Same situation.

The lever stands between.

DEMON: Fifteen. Or two.
       You know the math.
       What's the answer?

KANT: (looking at the tracks) There's no right answer.

DEMON: There's always an answer. People just don't like admitting it.
```

---

**SCENE 3B: The Tracks (6:30-8:00)**

**FROM THE MAIN TRACK:**

```
CHEERLEADER: (not screaming, just clear) Pull the lever.

JOCK: (angry) Fifteen to two. That's not even a question.

ANOTHER KID: (scared) Please. I don't even know them.
```

**FROM THE SIDE TRACK:**

Diogenes and Carol don't beg. They watch.

```
DIOGENES: (to Carol, conversational) This is new.

CAROL: (dry) Yeah.

DIOGENES: (to Kant) You're not gonna pull it.

It's not a question. It's an observation.

KANT: How do you know?

DIOGENES: Because you sat down.

CAROL: (to Diogenes) That doesn't make sense.

DIOGENES: It makes perfect sense.
```

---

**SCENE 3C: The Choice (8:00-9:30)**

```
The train moves. Slowly.

DEMON: Clock's ticking.

KANT: (to the Demon) If I pull the lever, I kill them.

DEMON: If you don't, they die.

KANT: There's a difference.

DEMON: Is there?

KANT: (looking at the lever) I didn't create this. You did.
      Whatever happens on that track—the train is killing them. Not me.
      But if I pull this lever—I'm the one who decides who dies.
      I become part of it.

DEMON: That's just philosophy.

KANT: (quiet) It's all I have.

He steps back from the lever.

The fifteen students SCREAM.

The train moves—

—and stops.

Everything freezes. The Demon watches.

DEMON: You'd let fifteen people die for two strangers.

KANT: I'd refuse to kill two people for fifteen strangers.
      It's not the same thing.

DEMON: (long beat) ...Interesting.

The tracks dissolve. Reality flickers back.
```

---

### RESOLUTION (9:30-10:30)

**SCENE 4: The Return**

*Back in the hallway. Normal.*

```
Kant is at his locker. Books in hand. Like nothing happened.

He closes the locker. Walks toward the exit.

At the door: Diogenes and Carol. Waiting.

Not for him specifically. They're just... there.

DIOGENES: (seeing him) Oh. You again.

KANT: (flat) Me again.

CAROL: We're going to the van.

It's not an invitation. It's information.

Kant walks with them.

DIOGENES: You look weird.

KANT: I had a strange afternoon.

CAROL: Want to talk about it?

KANT: No.

DIOGENES: (approving) Good answer.
```

---

### TAG (10:30-11:00)

**SCENE 5: The Joke**

*The van. Sunset.*

```
The three of them, sitting on the roof now. Watching the empty parking lot.

Silence. Comfortable.

CAROL: You ever think about the trolley problem?

DIOGENES: (groaning) No.

CAROL: (to Kant) You?

KANT: (beat) Sometimes.

CAROL: What would you do?

KANT: (deadpan) Kill you both.

CAROL: ...What?

KANT: Fifteen is greater than two. The math is simple.

They stare at him.

Long beat.

KANT: (tiny smile) That was a joke.

DIOGENES: (exhaling) Jesus.

CAROL: Your delivery is insane.

KANT: I'm working on it.

DIOGENES: (laughing now) Don't. Keep it exactly like that.

They sit. Sun going down. Something has started.

FADE OUT.
```

---

## POST-CREDITS STING (5 seconds)

A file folder. Someone's desk.

**"KANT, I. - SUBJECT IDENTIFIED"**

Other folders visible: **"DIOGENES" / "GILLIGAN, C."**

And more. Many more.

---

## WHAT THIS PILOT ESTABLISHES

1. **Kant**: Precise, principled, socially awkward—but not cold. Willing to be misunderstood for his beliefs.
2. **Diogenes**: Lives in a van, carries a flashlight, tells the Demon to leave. Honest to the point of provocation, but surprisingly tender.
3. **Carol**: The one who notices feelings, sees who's left out, asks hard questions gently. Gets fierce when needed.
4. **The Dynamic**: Misfits who found each other. Each embodies a philosophical tradition without knowing it.
5. **The Evil Demon**: Reveals, not deceives. Has appeared to all of them. They don't talk about it much.
6. **The Tone**: Philosophical without being academic. Funny without being silly. Strange without being scary.
7. **The Mystery**: What are they? Why do they think like this? The show knows. It's not telling.
8. **The Vibe**: Cool through opting out, not losers who got excluded. Magnetic, not quirky.

---

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Muse Protocol

This document should undergo 30-50 iterations before production. Key areas to iterate:

1. **Pacing**—does the debate drag? Can sections be tightened?
2. **Dialogue authenticity**—do the philosophers sound distinct enough?
3. **The dilemma**—is it relatable enough? Too simple?
4. **The non-resolution**—does it feel earned or frustrating?
5. **The return**—does the viewer feel satisfied?
6. **Cool factor**—are the misfits magnetic or just weird?

### Voice Synthesis Profiles (If Audio Component)

| Character | Voice Profile |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Kant** | Germanic, precise, measured pauses (2 sec before responses) |
| **Diogenes** | Rough, Greek-adjacent, barking laugh, eating sounds |
| **Carol** | American, warm, therapeutic cadence |
| **Aristotle** | Warm Greek, pacing footsteps in background |
| **Pascal** | French-thin, nervous, variable pace |

---

## OPEN CREATIVE QUESTIONS

1. **How literal is the Evil Demon?** (Kant's imagination? A real entity? The show never tells us.)
2. **How stylized is the animation?** (Grounded realism? Expressionist? Glitch aesthetic?)
3. **Is Kant's reasoning always right?** (Should future episodes challenge him?)
4. **What's the recurring structure?** (Every episode has a philosophical dilemma? The Demon appears when?)
5. **Who introduces Aristotle and Pascal?** (Episode 4? Episode 7?)
6. **Format flexibility?** (Could be animation, could be podcast with visual companion, could be hybrid)
