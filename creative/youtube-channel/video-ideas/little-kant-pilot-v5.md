## PRODUCTION NOTES FOR VOICE AI

This script is formatted for AI voice synthesis and audio drama production.

**Voice Profiles:**

| Character | Voice Direction |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **KANT** | Male, 15, German accent (subtle, not caricature). Precise articulation. 1-2 second pauses before responses. Never rushed. Slightly flat affect that warms when he makes his rare jokes. |
| **DIOGENES** | Male/neutral, 16, Greek-adjacent American. Rough, slightly gravelly. Barking laugh. Casual about profound things. Sound of eating when noted. |
| **CAROL** | Female, 15, American, warm therapeutic cadence. Can shift from gentle to fierce in one sentence. She notices before she speaks. |
| **DEMON** | Ageless, genderless. Layered voices—one clear, several whispered underneath. Not menacing, but unsettling. Curious more than cruel. |
| **CHEERLEADER** | Female, 15, American, clear and direct. Not a stereotype—genuinely rational in her terror. |
| **JOCK** | Male, 16, American, frustrated. Not dumb—just utilitarian. |
| **ANOTHER KID** | Male, 15, American, scared. Pleading. |

**Sound Design Notes:**
- Reality scenes: naturalistic school ambience
- Philosophy-space scenes: muted, reverb, industrial undertones
- The Grief Engine: steam, metal grinding, a heartbeat rhythm
- Transitions: a subtle "glitch" sound when reality shifts

## COLD OPEN

### SCENE 0: DEPARTURE
**[TIME: 0:00-1:00]**

*[AMBIENT: A quiet room. A clock ticking. Then another clock. Then a third. All slightly out of sync.]*

*[SFX: A pen being adjusted on a desk. The tiny scrape of plastic on wood.]*

**KANT:** *(to himself, barely audible)* There.

*[BEAT: Two seconds of silence.]*

*[SFX: Footsteps in a hallway. A woman's—his mother's—stopping at a doorway.]*

*[BEAT: She doesn't enter. He doesn't turn.]*

*[SFX: The click of a suitcase being lifted. Tags rustling—paper, plastic.]*

*[AMBIENT: Airport sounds fading in. Announcements in German. Then English.]*

*[SFX: Jet engine rising. The pressurized hum of a cabin.]*

*[BEAT: Silence except for the plane.]*

*[The engine hum continues under:]*

---

## TITLE CARD

**[TIME: 1:00-1:15]**

*[SFX: A single tone. Clean. Like a tuning fork.]*

**NARRATOR (V.O.):** *(optional, or just text on screen)* Little Kant.

*[BEAT: Silence.]*

---

## ACT ONE: THE ARRIVAL

### SCENE 1A: OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL
**[TIME: 1:15-2:00]**

*[AMBIENT: Queens, New York. Morning chaos. Kids talking, laughing, shouting. Cars. A bus. The distant thump of a basketball.]*

*[SFX: Footsteps—Kant's—steady, unhurried. He walks through the crowd.]*

*[The ambient sound flows AROUND him. He's not interacting with it.]*

*[SFX: A locker slamming. Someone laughing. A whistle from a coach.]*

*[BEAT: Kant stops.]*

*[SFX: Paper unfolding—his schedule.]*

*[BEAT: He looks at the building.]*

*[SFX: Footsteps resume. He walks in.]*

---

### SCENE 1B: THE PARKING LOT — LUNCH
**[TIME: 2:00-4:00]**

*[AMBIENT: Outdoor. Distant cafeteria noise. Birds. Cars passing on a nearby street.]*

*[SFX: Kant sitting on a bench. Opening a book. Pages turning.]*

*[BEAT: He reads. He's fine with it.]*

*[SFX: In the distance—someone climbing metal. A van door.]*

**DIOGENES:** *(from far away, not to Kant)* Yo.

*[SFX: An apple being bitten. Chewing.]*

*[Kant doesn't react.]*

*[SFX: Footsteps approaching—Carol's. She passes Kant's bench.]*

*[She glances at his book. She keeps walking.]*

*[SFX: Her footsteps continuing toward the van.]*

---

*[AMBIENT: Closer to the van now. Metal creaking as Carol climbs up.]*

*[SFX: She sits on the roof next to Diogenes.]*

**DIOGENES:** *(not a greeting—just a fact)* The lacrosse guys are fighting again.

**CAROL:** Which ones?

**DIOGENES:** Does it matter?

**CAROL:** *(considering)* Not really.

*[BEAT: They watch. Comfortable silence.]*

**DIOGENES:** New kid.

**CAROL:** German.

**DIOGENES:** How do you know?

**CAROL:** The book. The posture. The way he's not trying to look busy.

**DIOGENES:** *(interested now)* He's just sitting there. Reading.

**CAROL:** Yeah.

**DIOGENES:** That's kind of tight.

*[BEAT.]*

**CAROL:** Should we—

**DIOGENES:** Nah. If he's one of us, he'll find us.

**CAROL:** And if he's not?

**DIOGENES:** Then he won't.

*[AMBIENT: The school continues. Distant bell. Voices.]*

*[SFX: A book closing—Kant's. Footsteps. He's walking toward them.]*

---

*[SFX: Kant stops at the bumper of the van.]*

**DIOGENES:** *(not looking down)* You need something?

**KANT:** *(measured pause before answering)* No.

**DIOGENES:** Then why are you here?

**KANT:** *(honest)* I don't know yet.

*[BEAT: Diogenes finally looks down.]*

**DIOGENES:** You're not scared of us.

**KANT:** Should I be?

**DIOGENES:** *(to Carol)* He's not scared of us.

**CAROL:** I noticed.

**DIOGENES:** *(to Kant)* Most people don't come over.

**KANT:** I'm not most people.

**CAROL:** *(dry)* Obviously.

*[BEAT: Nobody's performing anything.]*

**DIOGENES:** You gonna stand there?

**KANT:** Is there somewhere else to sit?

*[SFX: Diogenes gestures. A crate being dragged. Kant sits.]*

*[AMBIENT: They exist in the same space. Watching the school.]*

*[BEAT: Comfortable silence.]*

**CAROL:** What were you reading?

**KANT:** Kant.

**CAROL:** *(no reaction)* Any good?

**KANT:** *(considers—two-second pause)* He's very certain about things.

**DIOGENES:** *(snorts)* Is that good or bad?

**KANT:** I haven't decided.

*[BEAT: Nothing more. A distant bell rings.]*

**DIOGENES:** We stay through sixth period. It's a free.

*[It's not an invitation. It's information.]*

**KANT:** *(getting up)* I have class.

**CAROL:** Tomorrow, then.

**KANT:** Maybe.

*[SFX: His footsteps walking away. He doesn't look back.]*

**DIOGENES:** *(watching him go)* He'll be back.

**CAROL:** Yeah.

**DIOGENES:** How do you know?

**CAROL:** *(simply)* He sat down.

## ACT TWO: THE EVIL DEMON APPEARS

### SCENE 2: THE SHIFT
**[TIME: 4:00-5:30]**

*[AMBIENT: School hallway. End of day. Lockers. Distant voices. Then... too quiet.]*

*[SFX: Kant at his locker. Books being arranged. Precise movements.]*

*[SFX: Lights flickering. An electrical hum.]*

*[Kant doesn't react. Keeps packing.]*

*[AMBIENT: The hallway is empty now. Too empty. The air has changed.]*

**DEMON:** *(V.O. — layered voices, one clear, others whispering underneath)* You made a choice today.

*[Kant doesn't startle. He turns slowly.]*

**KANT:** I sat with some people.

**DEMON:** Is that what you call it?

**KANT:** What would you call it?

**DEMON:** *(almost amused)* The beginning of something you can't take back.

*[BEAT: They regard each other.]*

**KANT:** What do you want?

**DEMON:** To show you what you're really choosing.

*[SFX: Reality warping—a glitch sound, the hallway stretching. Reverb increases.]*

**DEMON:** Everyone thinks about the trolley problem. But nobody really *chooses*.

*[BEAT]*

**DEMON:** Until now.

---

## ACT THREE: THE TROLLEY PROBLEM

### SCENE 3A: THE SETUP
**[TIME: 5:30-6:30]**

*[AMBIENT: Industrial space. Cold. Echoing. Railroad tracks.]*

*[SFX: Steam. Metal grinding. A rhythmic sound—like a heartbeat, but mechanical.]*

*[SFX: The Grief Engine approaching. Distant at first. Growing louder.]*

**DEMON:** *(narrating the space into existence)* The Greater Good Express.

*[SFX: A train whistle. But wrong—hollow, mournful.]*

**DEMON:** Fifteen on the main track. Two on the side. The lever is between.

*[AMBIENT: Voices—the fifteen. Murmurs of fear. Chains rattling.]*

*[Closer: Diogenes and Carol. Calm.]*

**KANT:** *(observing)* This isn't real.

**DEMON:** Reality is what you choose to do.

**KANT:** That's not an answer.

**DEMON:** It's the only answer that matters. Fifteen. Or two. You know the math. What's the answer?

**KANT:** *(looking at the tracks)* There's no right answer.

**DEMON:** There's always an answer. People just don't like admitting it.

---

### SCENE 3B: THE TRACKS
**[TIME: 6:30-8:00]**

*[AMBIENT: The train getting closer. Heartbeat rhythm.]*

*[FROM THE MAIN TRACK:]*

**CHEERLEADER:** *(not screaming—clear, rational)* Pull the lever.

**JOCK:** *(angry, frustrated)* Fifteen to two. That's not even a question.

**ANOTHER KID:** *(scared, pleading)* Please. I don't even know them.

*[FROM THE SIDE TRACK:]*

*[Diogenes and Carol don't beg. They watch.]*

**DIOGENES:** *(to Carol, conversational—almost bored)* This is new.

**CAROL:** *(dry)* Yeah.

**DIOGENES:** *(to Kant, observational)* You're not gonna pull it.

*[It's not a question.]*

**KANT:** How do you know?

**DIOGENES:** Because you sat down.

**CAROL:** *(to Diogenes)* That doesn't make sense.

**DIOGENES:** It makes perfect sense.

---

### SCENE 3C: THE CHOICE
**[TIME: 8:00-9:15]**

*[SFX: The train closer now. Wheels on tracks. The heartbeat faster.]*

**DEMON:** Clock's ticking.

**KANT:** *(to the Demon, measured)* If I pull the lever, I kill them.

**DEMON:** If you don't, they die.

**KANT:** *(pause)* There's a difference.

**DEMON:** Is there?

**KANT:** *(looking at the lever, speaking slowly—working it out)* I didn't create this. You did. Whatever happens on that track—the train is killing them. Not me. But if I pull this lever... I'm the one who decides who dies. I become part of it.

**DEMON:** That's just philosophy.

**KANT:** *(quiet, certain)* It's all I have.

*[BEAT.]*

*[SFX: He steps back from the lever. Footstep. Distance.]*

*[The fifteen students SCREAM—loud, real, terrified.]*

*[SFX: The train accelerating—]*

*[—and stopping. Sudden silence.]*

*[Everything freezes.]*

**DEMON:** *(after a long pause)* You'd let fifteen people die for two strangers.

**KANT:** *(firm)* I'd refuse to kill two people for fifteen strangers. It's not the same thing.

**DEMON:** *(longer pause—something shifts in the voice, the layered whispers settle)*

...Interesting.

*[SFX: The glitch sound. Reality dissolving. The tracks fading.]*

---

## RESOLUTION

### SCENE 4: THE RETURN
**[TIME: 9:15-10:30]**

*[AMBIENT: Normal hallway. End of day. Lockers. Distant voices.]*

*[Kant is at his locker. Books in hand. Like nothing happened.]*

*[SFX: Locker closing.]*

*[SFX: His footsteps toward the exit.]*

*[At the door:]*

**DIOGENES:** *(seeing him)* Oh. You again.

**KANT:** *(flat)* Me again.

**CAROL:** We're going to the van.

*[It's not an invitation. It's information.]*

*[SFX: Three sets of footsteps. Walking together.]*

**DIOGENES:** You look weird.

**KANT:** I had a strange afternoon.

**CAROL:** *(gently)* Want to talk about it?

**KANT:** *(pause)* No.

**DIOGENES:** *(approving)* Good answer.

*[AMBIENT: Outdoor. Parking lot. The van.]*

*[SFX: Climbing onto the roof.]*

---

## TAG

### SCENE 5: THE JOKE
**[TIME: 10:30-11:00]**

*[AMBIENT: Sunset. Parking lot nearly empty. Birds. A distant car.]*

*[The three of them, sitting on the van roof. Watching nothing.]*

*[BEAT: Comfortable silence.]*

**CAROL:** You ever think about the trolley problem?

**DIOGENES:** *(groaning)* No.

**CAROL:** *(to Kant)* You?

**KANT:** *(beat—two seconds)* Sometimes.

**CAROL:** What would you do?

**KANT:** *(perfectly deadpan)* Kill you both.

*[BEAT: Shock.]*

**CAROL:** ...What?

**KANT:** Fifteen is greater than two. The math is simple.

*[They stare at him. Long, uncomfortable silence.]*

*[BEAT—four seconds.]*

**KANT:** *(the tiniest smile creeping in)* That was a joke.

**DIOGENES:** *(exhaling hard, relieved laugh)* Jesus.

**CAROL:** Your delivery is insane.

**KANT:** I'm working on it.

**DIOGENES:** *(laughing now)* Don't. Keep it exactly like that.

*[AMBIENT: Sunset. The three of them. Something has started.]*

*[BEAT.]*

*[SFX: The sound of an apple being bitten—Diogenes sharing.]*

*[FADE: Ambient sounds slowly lower.]*

---

## POST-CREDITS STING

**[TIME: 5 seconds]**

*[AMBIENT: Office. Quiet. Papers shuffling.]*

*[SFX: A file folder being opened. Pages turning.]*

**UNKNOWN VOICE:** *(clinical, detached—new character)* Subject identified.

*[BEAT.]*

**UNKNOWN VOICE:** Tag him.

*[SFX: File closing.]*

*[SILENCE.]*

## APPENDIX: PRODUCTION GUIDANCE

### For NotebookLM or Voice AI Generation

**Scene Transitions:**
- Use the [AMBIENT] tags as audio bed cues
- [SFX] tags are discrete sound effects
- [BEAT] indicates intentional silence—let it breathe
- Kant's pauses before speaking should be 1-2 seconds

**Emotional Arcs:**
- Scene 1: Neutral → cautious curiosity
- Scene 2: Normalcy → uncanny
- Scene 3: Tension → ethical stand → release
- Scene 4-5: Relief → connection → humor

**The Core Tone:**
This is not horror. The Demon is unsettling, not scary. The stakes are philosophical, not violent. The train stops because this is a test, not a threat. The show asks questions; it doesn't answer them.

### Character Voice Reminders

**KANT** speaks like someone translating from German in his head. Precise. Never says "I feel like"—says "I observe that" or "I think that." His humor is deadpan and rare.

**DIOGENES** speaks like someone who has nothing to lose. Casual about profound things. Biting into an apple while the world ends. The flashlight is never explained.

**CAROL** speaks like a therapist's kid. Warm. Notices things. "Want to talk about it?" comes naturally to her. But she can get fierce—one line, the whole tone shifts.

**THE DEMON** is not the devil. It's not evil. It's more like... a mirror that asks you questions you don't want to answer. Curious. Patient. Never tells you what to do.

---

## SERIES SETUP (What This Pilot Establishes)

1. **Kant**: Precise, principled, socially awkward—but not cold. Willing to be misunderstood for his beliefs.

2. **Diogenes**: Lives in a van, carries a flashlight, tells the Demon to leave ("Get out of my sunlight"). Honest to the point of provocation, but surprisingly tender.

3. **Carol (Gilligan)**: The one who notices feelings, sees who's left out, asks hard questions gently. Gets fierce when needed.

4. **The Dynamic**: Misfits who found each other. Each embodies a philosophical tradition without knowing it.

5. **The Evil Demon**: Reveals, not deceives. Has appeared to all of them. They don't talk about it much.

6. **The Grief Engine**: The trolley problem made literal—"The Greater Good Express." It will return.

7. **The Mystery**: Someone is watching. Filing. Tagging. There are more of them out there.

8. **The Vibe**: Cool through opting out, not losers who got excluded. Magnetic, not quirky.

---

## WHAT COMES NEXT

**Episode 2: "The Flashlight"** — Diogenes focus. When radical honesty hurts someone vulnerable. The flashlight is almost explained. Almost.

**Episode 3: "The Web"** — Gilligan focus. Keeping a harmful secret vs. breaking trust. Carol has to choose between two people she cares about.

**Episode 4: "The Bet"** — Pascal is introduced. Decision under uncertainty. Faith and probability. He's already seen the Demon.

**Episode 5: "Could Everyone?"** — Kant vs. Gilligan. When duty and care genuinely conflict. Neither is wrong. Both can't win.

*"They're not studying philosophy. They ARE philosophy."*
