# Storytelling Techniques for Moral Education in Children's Media

> *"The moral of the story? Kids don't always understand the moral."* — NPR Research Summary

This document synthesizes research on effective storytelling techniques for ethical education in children's media. The core insight: **moral lessons that feel like sermons fail; moral lessons embedded in compelling narrative succeed**.

---

## 1. Narrative Techniques

### 1.1 Show, Don't Tell (vs. Preachy Exposition)

The most critical distinction in children's ethical storytelling is between **embedded ethics** and **stated ethics**.

**The Problem with Direct Moralizing**

Research from UC Davis and Iowa State University reveals a troubling pattern:

> "In a typical 12 minutes of content, children often see nine minutes of exclusionary behavior or a problem being presented with only three minutes or less of a solution. The solutions presented often don't resonate positively with child viewers."

This ratio problem — 75% conflict, 25% resolution — means children absorb the *behavior* more than the *lesson*. Even worse:

> "In most cases, programs reinforced stereotypes and increased stigmatization rather than teaching children to behave otherwise."

**What Works: Behavioral Modeling Without Lecture**

*Bluey* exemplifies the "show, don't tell" approach:

> "We want to make kids laugh. We also want each episode to be about something and about real life. Kids are exposed to serious issues at a young age, and Bluey refuses to shy away from it."

The show uses **play as pedagogy**. In the episode "Early Baby," Bluey's friend Indy incorporates her experience with her premature baby sister into a game of doctors, teaching viewers about premature birth without a single lecture.

*Hilda* takes an even more subtle approach:

> "Hilda doesn't pander with moral lessons or talk down to its viewers — child or adult. Not one episode ends with her killing the bad guy. Rather than leveling up weapons, Hilda approaches conflict with reason and empathy."

**Practical Techniques**

| Technique | Example | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Character consequences** | Simba's pride leads to exile | Behavior causes outcome naturally |
| **Behavioral contrast** | Zuko's choices vs. Azula's | Viewers compare without being told |
| **Environmental storytelling** | Post-war landscapes in *Avatar* | Shows impact without exposition |
| **Character observation** | Other characters react to behavior | Social feedback models real life |

**The Old-School Exception: Explicit Morals for Preschoolers**

For very young children (ages 4-6), research shows some direct explanation helps:

> "Research among U.S. populations indicates that the ability to articulate a moral theme develops fairly slowly, emerging only around age 9 or 10."

*Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood* uses "strategy songs" — catchy musical summaries like "When you're feeling frustrated, take a step back and ask for help." These work because they:
- Are repeated throughout episodes
- Map to specific behavioral scenarios
- Give children language for emotions

A UCLA study found that teens who watched *Daniel Tiger* as preschoolers still used the calming techniques they learned years later.

### 1.2 Moral Complexity Through Character Conflict

The shift from Manichean (good vs. evil) storytelling to morally complex narratives represents a fundamental evolution in children's media.

**The Balance Philosophy**

*Avatar: The Last Airbender* showrunners articulated their core philosophy:

> "A core philosophy of the series is that people aren't good or evil, but are either in balance or out of balance."

This framing accomplishes something remarkable: it maintains moral standards while allowing for character growth. Characters can be "wrong" without being "evil," which:
- Allows for redemption arcs
- Teaches that good people can make bad choices
- Models recovery from moral failure

**Internal vs. External Conflict**

The most compelling ethical dilemmas are internal:

| Show | Internal Conflict | Ethical Question |
|------|-------------------|------------------|
| *Avatar* | Aang's pacifism vs. his duty | Can you defeat evil without becoming evil? |
| *Steven Universe* | Steven's identity crisis | How do you become yourself when everyone expects you to be someone else? |
| *She-Ra* | Adora's indoctrination vs. truth | What do you owe to people who raised you but deceived you? |
| *Adventure Time* | Ice King's lost identity | Is a person responsible for actions they can't control? |

**The "Crossroads of Destiny" Model**

The *Avatar* Season 2 finale provides a masterclass in moral complexity. Zuko is presented with two paths:
- Join his uncle Iroh and embrace goodness
- Betray Iroh for his father's approval

**Crucially, he chooses wrong.** This narrative choice was essential:

> "When faced with the final choice to switch sides, Zuko failed. It was a necessary failure. Narratively, his turn in Season 3 is more earned by virtue of him finally receiving everything he wanted [and realizing it wasn't enough]."

This teaches children that:
1. Good people can make bad choices under pressure
2. Redemption doesn't happen in a single moment
3. The journey to moral clarity is non-linear

---

### 1.3 Consequences as Natural Story Outcomes

**The Causal Chain**

Effective ethical storytelling establishes clear cause-effect relationships:

> "When children witness characters benefiting from sustainable choices or facing consequences for harmful actions, they are more likely to internalize these lessons."

The key is **natural consequences** vs. **imposed punishment**:

| Natural Consequence | Imposed Punishment |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Friends don't trust you after you lie | Parent grounds you for lying |
| Your impulsive plan fails | Teacher lectures you about planning |
| You feel lonely after pushing people away | Narrator tells you isolation is bad |

*Hilda* handles this elegantly:

> "Hilda often creates problems through her impulsiveness, and the show doesn't let her off the hook. She has to work through the fallout of her decisions, apologize when she's wrong, and figure out solutions."

**The Zuko Principle**

*Avatar* never lets Zuko off easily. His redemption arc spans three seasons because:

> "He suffers for what he has done. He suffers to improve. The heroes do not reward him with trust until after they, and the viewers, are certain he deserves it."

When Zuko finally joins Team Avatar, they don't immediately trust him. He must earn their trust episode by episode. This models real social dynamics: trust is rebuilt through consistent behavior over time, not through apology alone.

**Stakes and Weight**

> "Children's media teaches forgiveness and empathy and can do so without engaging in serious moral questions by having low stakes. But when the characters' actions are given real weight, and real consequences, redemption becomes infinitely harder."

This is why *Avatar* resonates: Zuko's choices have real costs. Aang's pacifism isn't easily compatible with saving the world. The show trusts children to grapple with these tensions.

---

### 1.4 Using Humor to Explore Serious Topics

**The Bluey Approach: Laughing Together**

*Bluey* producer Daley Pearson describes their dual mandate:

> "There are really two things going on. One is making the kids laugh. We also want each episode to be about something and about real life and what parenting is like."

The show tackles ageing, separation anxiety, infertility, parenting struggles, premature birth, the afterlife, traumatic memories, separated families, invisible illnesses, and insecurity — all through the lens of play and gentle humor.

> "The episode is gently humorous and doesn't get too heavy, but explains the concept sensitively in a way that children can easily grasp."

**The Good Place: Philosophy Through Comedy**

*The Good Place* (while not strictly for children, influential for family viewing) demonstrates how humor can make philosophy accessible:

> "The most famous, and arguably the best, use of the trolley problem is in *The Good Place* — a sitcom that cleverly teaches you a lot of moral philosophy without knowing it."

UCLA philosophy professor Pamela Hieronymi, who consulted on the show:

> "The show dramatizes actual ethics classes and concepts on screen without dumbing down the concepts being described, and in this way, it serves as an informal educational tool."

**Humor Functions**

| Function | Example | Why It Works |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **Tension release** | Comic relief after heavy moments | Prevents emotional overwhelm |
| **Entry point** | Absurdist setup for serious theme | Disarms resistance |
| **Memory hook** | Funny scene embeds lesson | Easier to recall than lecture |
| **Multi-generational** | Parent laughs at different jokes | Creates shared viewing |

*Bluey*'s 7-minute format proves that brevity + humor creates engagement:

> "Only 11% of the episodes are watched solo. Put 'Bluey' on at home, and the first thing that happens is the kids jump up and start dancing to the theme tune. Then they start laughing at what is going on. The parents then start laughing because there are jokes in there for parents too. Suddenly you are in the middle of this family situation where everyone is having a good time."

## 2. Character Archetypes for Ethics

### 2.1 The Flawed Hero Learning

**Why Perfection Fails**

> "Perpetual examples of unachievable perfection can lead to great discouragement in a child. When characters in books or shows are always flawless, it is only the villains who struggle, and only the bad guys who make errors in judgment."

The flawed hero serves a cathartic function:

> "Research in narrative psychology suggests that flawed characters allow audiences to explore moral struggles vicariously. Perfect characters exist in a place we might admire, but we aren't really going to relate to them."

**The Essential Flaw-Growth-Struggle Pattern**

Effective flawed heroes:
1. **Have a clear flaw** tied to their identity
2. **Face consequences** from that flaw
3. **Struggle to overcome** — failing sometimes
4. **Grow authentically** over time

**Simba (The Lion King)**

> "As a young cub, Simba's character flaws are embodied in 'I Just Can't Wait to Be King.' He demonstrates ambition, pride, and disobedience. However, looking deeper, his true 'flaw' is a feeling of inferiority. He lives in the shadow of his father and constantly strives to prove his worth."

**Aang (Avatar: The Last Airbender)**

Aang's flaw is avoidance — he literally ran away from his responsibilities. The show never lets him forget this:

> "In an age of brooding, melodramatic, and angst-filled heroes, Aang provides a refreshing counterexample to what it means to be an emotionally intelligent, internally resilient, and ethically principled individual."

His growth comes from facing what he fled, culminating in a creative solution (energybending) that honors both his duty and his values.

**The Learning Journey**

> "Unlike those dull characters who are already perfect at the novel's start, flawed heroes need to learn lessons, often difficult and painful ones. They have to wrestle with their weaknesses, make harrowing choices, adapt, and mature."

---

### 2.2 The Antagonist with Understandable Motivations

**The Sympathetic Villain Purpose**

> "The act of showing how a villain came to be helps children understand that traumatic or unfortunate experiences have the power to bring people to do cruel or 'evil' things. A tragic backstory is not to confuse the villain's actions with being right, but to show that people often have a motive for what they are doing."

**Ice King (Adventure Time)**

The Ice King's evolution exemplifies this:

> "Originally introduced as an evil but incompetent wizard obsessed with kidnapping princesses, he was depicted in later seasons as a lonely man driven insane by a magical crown which grants him ice powers."

The revelation that Simon Petrikov was once a loving man who slowly lost his mind to save Marceline during the apocalypse transformed audience perception:

> "TV.com stated, 'It's sort of amazing how Adventure Time has transformed the Ice King from an irritating antagonist to one of the most tragic figures on television.'"

**The Invisible Line**

Zuko's arc works because of careful calibration:

> "While he made plenty of morally wrong choices while chasing Aang, the show ensures that Zuko never crosses the invisible line. In 'The Storm,' Zuko is caught between two choices: chase the Avatar or save his crew members. Zuko makes the honorable choice of saving lives over his goal."

This maintains his redeemability while keeping him a genuine threat.

**Shadow Weaver (She-Ra)**

A more complex example:

> "Shadow Weaver is a deconstruction of the Abusive Parents, Evil Mentor, and Svengali archetypes. She adopted Adora because she sensed power and potential, and planned to groom her into being the leader of the Horde."

She's never fully redeemed, which teaches a different lesson: some people change behavior without changing nature.

**Avoiding Moral Relativism**

The risk of sympathetic villains:

> "Moral relativism is the idea that 'no one is right or wrong, and everyone's opinion is equally right.' The problem is that once you subscribe to this idea, right and wrong lose all meaning."

The solution is to **explain motivations without excusing actions**. We understand why Zuko hunts Aang, but we never think he's right to do so.

---

### 2.3 The Moral Mentor Figure

**Uncle Iroh: The Gold Standard**

> "Zuko's arc wouldn't be nearly as compelling without the guiding hand of his Uncle Iroh. Iroh tries his best to lead Zuko down a better path throughout the show but finds himself rebuffed by his single-minded nephew."

What makes Iroh effective:
- **He doesn't force** — he guides
- **He has his own arc** — recovering from grief and war crimes
- **He respects agency** — Zuko must choose for himself
- **He embodies the philosophy** — he lives what he teaches

> "Their separation reinforces an important theme: while Iroh could guide Zuko, only Zuko could choose to do the right thing. Making that decision on his own is incredibly moving."

**The Deconstructed Mentor: Shadow Weaver**

*She-Ra* subverts the mentor archetype:

> "Shadow Weaver serves as the Mentor Archetype to Adora and Micah, with flashbacks showing her mentoring Micah in magical arts. She also becomes a mentor to Glimmer."

But she's manipulative and self-serving, teaching viewers to evaluate mentors critically rather than blindly trusting authority.

**Mentor Archetypes**

| Type | Example | Function |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Wise Guide** | Uncle Iroh | Models wisdom, patience, redemption |
| **Flawed Mentor** | Mr. Bao (Kung Fu Panda) | Shows even teachers have limits |
| **Dark Mentor** | Shadow Weaver | Teaches critical evaluation of authority |
| **Absent Mentor** | Parents in many shows | Forces protagonist to find their own path |
| **Peer Mentor** | Katara to Aang | Shows learning from equals |

---

### 2.4 Characters Representing Different Ethical Frameworks

**The Ecosystem Approach**

Shows like *Avatar* and *She-Ra* populate their worlds with characters embodying different ethical orientations:

**Avatar's Ethical Frameworks**

| Character | Framework | Example |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Aang | Deontological (duty-based) | Refuses to kill regardless of consequences |
| Sokka | Pragmatic/Utilitarian | Focuses on what works |
| Katara | Care Ethics | Prioritizes relationships and compassion |
| Zuko | Virtue Ethics (developing) | Struggles with "what kind of person am I?" |
| Azula | Pure Consequentialism | Victory justifies any means |

**She-Ra's Character Ecosystem**

> "The series broadens the concept of strength beyond physical prowess. Emotional resilience, intellectual sharpness, and moral integrity are equally valorized. Characters like Bow and Scorpia illustrate that compassion and loyalty are also forms of strength."

> "Characters inhabit a complicated moral tapestry, which represents what having access to full personhood looks like — being able to play characters that aren't just there to be the moral of the story, but are there to advance the story, to escalate conflict and just cause trouble."

**Fusion as Ethical Metaphor (Steven Universe)**

> "Fusion — when two gems perform a special dance and become in-sync, their bodies fuse together into a new gem representative of their relationship. This is a key concept in both storytelling and spectacle, and seeing how characters blend together adds enjoyment to episodes."

Fusion literalizes ethical synthesis: different perspectives combining to create something new.

---

## 3. Episodic vs. Serialized Morality

### 3.1 Single-Episode Lessons

**Advantages**

> "Episodic storytelling offers flexibility and accessibility. It presents self-contained narratives resolved within single episodes, allowing viewers to watch in any order."

For moral education, this means:
- **Low barrier to entry** — any episode can teach a lesson
- **Complete arcs** — problem, struggle, resolution in 22 minutes
- **Repetition-friendly** — rewatching reinforces lessons

**Limitations**

> "Since takeaways can't really carry over into the next episode, the lessons learned are usually superficial at best, and they have no permanent bearing on the character."

Classic episodic shows (*Arthur*, *Daniel Tiger*) work for preschoolers but frustrate older children who notice that characters never truly change.

### 3.2 Season-Long Arcs

**The Serialization Revolution**

> "Gravity Falls and Steven Universe are often cited as real game-changers, being tightly-connected in their stories and pushing the boundaries on content for 7-12 year old audiences."

Serialized storytelling enables:
- **Earned character growth** — change happens gradually
- **Consequence accumulation** — past actions matter
- **Complex moral situations** — nuance builds over time
- **Investment in outcomes** — viewers care because they've journeyed together

**The *Avatar* Model**

Zuko's redemption requires three seasons:

> "The actual progress of Zuko's character arc is slow and painstaking, and never linear. He suffers for what he has done. He suffers to improve."

This couldn't work episodically. Each episode builds on the last, and viewers who've watched from the beginning experience the full weight of his transformation.

### 3.3 The Hybrid Approach

> "Hybrid approaches maintain primarily self-contained episodes with ongoing subplots, introducing character development arcs that span multiple episodes while incorporating recurring themes throughout a season."

*Gravity Falls* exemplifies this:

> "Creator Alex Hirsch has said much of Gravity Falls was inspired by his own childhood. Every piece of dialogue, character design, and location has purpose, yet it never feels overbearing or pedantic — it's always fun, welcoming, and warm."

Episodes work standalone, but recurring mysteries and character growth reward loyal viewers.

**Age Appropriateness**

| Age | Format | Reasoning |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| 2-5 | Episodic | Limited memory, need repetition |
| 6-8 | Hybrid | Can track simple arcs |
| 9-12 | Serialized | Can handle complexity, crave continuity |
| 13+ | Heavily serialized | Expect consequences and growth |

## 4. The "Aesop" Problem

### 4.1 Why Heavy-Handed Morals Backfire with Tweens

**The Reactance Effect**

> "Teens tend to reject demands unless they are clearly linked to safety. By demanding teens follow certain views, you may turn something you really care about into a source of rebellion."

When a show signals "here's what you should learn," tweens often reject it precisely because it's prescribed.

**The Condescension Factor**

> "One of the many reasons that both children and adults love Bluey is because the show doesn't shy away from serious topics. In avoiding serious topics, other cartoons can seem condescending as it's an admission that they find children too immature to handle such events."

**Bluey's counter-approach:**

> "The writing in Bluey can be very subtle for a show aimed mostly at preschoolers. It often drops hints about family life that are picked up on in later episodes, or that help round out the world with a bit of extra information."

### 4.2 The Research Problem

**Lessons Can Backfire**

Studies show that well-intentioned lessons sometimes produce the opposite effect:

> "One skill that has proven difficult to teach through media is inclusivity. Multiple studies have shown that children are more likely to exclude others from their social group after viewing an episode explicitly designed to promote inclusion."

Why? The research suggests:
1. Children absorb the 9 minutes of exclusionary behavior
2. They miss the 3 minutes of correction
3. They model what they saw, not what they were told

### 4.3 What Works Instead

**Trust the Audience**

*The Good Place* approach:

> "The purpose of the show isn't to give us a prescriptive idea of morality, but to talk us through dilemmas and problems and to encourage us to think for ourselves about those issues."

**Embed, Don't State**

*Hilda*:

> "Without a shortage of ethical, moral and educational themes, Hilda embeds its analogies within and around recognizable fantasy tropes and characters."

**Let Viewers Discover**

*Adventure Time*:

> "The stories of characters are not simply moralistic — there is no right way to understand Ice King. The show introduces doubt into how audiences read characters at face-value."

## 5. Case Studies: Episodes and Arcs That Handled Ethics Brilliantly

### 5.1 "The Storm" (Avatar: The Last Airbender, S1E12)

**The Setup**

Two parallel flashbacks reveal the origins of both Aang and Zuko's journeys. Aang fled his responsibility; Zuko was scarred for showing compassion.

**Why It Works**

> "The twelfth episode 'The Storm' took the series' moral complexity to the next level, breaking the mold of classic portrayals of good and evil. The characters showcase an important lesson about how rare it is for any situation to be completely black and white."

**The Technique**

- **Parallel structure** — viewers see both backstories simultaneously
- **Moral ambiguity** — Aang's flight was understandable but had consequences
- **Humanizing the villain** — Zuko's scar represents his father's cruelty, not his own evil
- **No resolution** — questions raised aren't answered, just presented

### 5.2 "I Remember You" (Adventure Time, S4E25)

**The Setup**

Marceline and the Ice King sing together; flashbacks reveal Simon Petrikov (Ice King's former identity) cared for young Marceline during the apocalypse.

**Why It Works**

> "The fourth-season episode 'I Remember You,' which focuses on the Ice King's relationship with Marceline, is considered a turning point in the show's portrayal of Ice King."

**The Ethical Questions Raised**

> "Is a person responsible for actions they can't control? Marceline can't tell if Bubblegum's still regarding him as a creepy old codger, and Bubblegum can't tell if there's something actually wrong with him. It's a situation that expresses dramatically the difficulties of treating the neurologically atypical with both respect and appropriate care."

**The Technique**

- **Show, don't tell** — the song conveys emotion without exposition
- **Earned pathos** — built on seasons of character establishment
- **No easy answers** — Simon is gone; loving him means accepting loss
- **Visual storytelling** — the contrast between past and present is devastating

### 5.3 "George and the Tidy Castle" (Arthur, Asperger's episode)

**The Setup**

Arthur's friend George learns about Asperger's syndrome through a character named Carl.

**Why It Works**

Research from UC Davis:

> "Showing a main character experiencing life through the eyes of another character with Asperger's syndrome improved the ability of child viewers to take another person's perspective. It also increased the nuance of their moral judgments and moral reasoning. Just a single viewing positively influenced several aspects of cognitive and moral development."

**The Technique**

- **Perspective-taking** — viewers literally see through Carl's eyes
- **Normalization** — Carl is a person, not a lesson
- **Specificity** — concrete details about sensory experience
- **Integration** — Carl becomes part of the world, not a special episode character

### 5.4 Zuko's Full Redemption Arc (Avatar, S1-S3)

**The Structure**

1. **S1:** Antagonist with hints of depth ("The Storm")
2. **S2:** Growing complexity, temporary progress, critical failure
3. **S3:** Genuine transformation, earning trust, culminating sacrifice

**Key Moments**

| Episode | Arc Function |
|---------|--------------|
| "The Storm" (S1E12) | Origin reveal — we understand his pain |
| "Zuko Alone" (S2E7) | Isolation arc — stripped of identity |
| "Crossroads of Destiny" (S2E20) | Critical failure — chooses wrong |
| "The Day of Black Sun" (S3E10-11) | True turning point — rejects father |
| "The Western Air Temple" (S3E12) | Earning trust — must prove himself |
| "Sozin's Comet" (S3E18-21) | Redemption complete — sacrifices for others |

**Why It's the Gold Standard**

> "Zuko's redemption arc from villain to hero is considered by many to be the gold standard even among animated stories today. Rather than atoning with one big gesture, Zuko spends several episodes aiding the Avatar's friends and proving that he understands how much trouble he's caused."

**The Technique**

- **Non-linear progress** — setbacks are essential
- **Earned trust** — heroes don't forgive immediately
- **Active choice** — Zuko chooses good when it costs him everything
- **Mentor relationship** — Iroh's patience pays off only when Zuko is ready

### 5.5 "The Trolley Problem" (The Good Place, S2E5)

**The Setup**

Michael puts Chidi through realistic simulations of the trolley problem to "help him learn" (actually to torture him).

**Why It Works**

> "The show dramatizes actual ethics classes and concepts on screen without dumbing down the concepts being described. Chidi teaches the trolley problem thought experiment, but Michael's practical knowledge of the afterlife scoring system conflicts with Chidi's theoretical approach."

**The Technique**

- **Physical comedy + philosophy** — bloody trolley scenarios are darkly funny
- **Character-driven** — Michael's manipulation reveals his nature
- **No easy answers** — the trolley problem remains unsolved
- **Academic accuracy** — consulted actual philosophy professors
- **Won 2018 Hugo Award** for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form

### 5.6 The Hunter's Transformation (The Owl House)

**The Setup**

Hunter is introduced as a villain aligned with the Emperor's Coven, but reveals himself to be a victim of manipulation and abuse.

**The Technique**

Similar to Zuko's arc but compressed:
- **Gradual revelation** of his circumstances
- **Earning trust** — he must prove his defection is genuine
- **Found family** — the theme of chosen relationships vs. imposed ones
- **No full forgiveness** — some characters remain wary, realistically

---

## 6. Synthesis: Principles for Ethical Storytelling

### The Core Tension

Every show must navigate between:
- **Clarity** (children need to understand) ↔ **Complexity** (real ethics is nuanced)
- **Resolution** (children need closure) ↔ **Ambiguity** (real life rarely resolves)
- **Safety** (parents expect wholesomeness) ↔ **Truth** (children deserve honesty)

### Principles That Work

1. **Embed, don't state** — Ethics should emerge from story, not be imposed on it
2. **Trust young audiences** — They can handle complexity; condescension breeds rejection
3. **Use natural consequences** — Actions cause outcomes; skip the lectures
4. **Allow failure** — Characters who never fail never earn redemption
5. **Populate with perspectives** — Multiple ethical frameworks create dialogue
6. **Make mentors flawed** — Perfect wisdom is unrelatable and unrealistic
7. **Humanize antagonists** — Understanding motivation ≠ excusing behavior
8. **Use humor to soften entry** — Laughter opens doors that lectures close
9. **Build across time** — The best ethical arcs are earned over seasons
10. **Leave questions open** — Moral discovery continues after credits roll

### The Final Insight

From Overthinking It's analysis of *Adventure Time*:

> "In Adventure Time there is a willingness to upend Manichaeism and plunge its viewers into a universe where all becomes unfixed and bizarre, where the dream-like disintegration of traditional spatial and temporal limitations mirrors the questioning of established social concepts of morality and identity."

The best children's shows don't teach ethics — they create environments where children can discover ethical thinking for themselves.
