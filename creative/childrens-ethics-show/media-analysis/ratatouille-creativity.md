# Ratatouille (2007): Innate Curiosity and the Urge to Be Creative

*A media analysis for the Little Kant children's philosophy show*

---

## Overview

Pixar's *Ratatouille* (directed by Brad Bird, 2007) is not merely an animated film about a rat who cooks. It is a sustained philosophical meditation on creativity, gatekeeping, and the moral imperative of following one's nature. The film achieves what few children's films attempt: it makes an argument for aesthetic excellence while simultaneously democratizing access to that excellence.

## 1. "Anyone Can Cook" as Philosophy

### Gusteau's Radical Claim

Auguste Gusteau's motto—"Anyone can cook"—functions as the film's central thesis. But the film is sophisticated enough to interrogate what this claim actually means.

**What it does NOT mean:**
- Everyone will become a great cook
- Skill is unnecessary
- Standards don't matter
- All attempts are equally valid

**What it DOES mean:**
- Greatness can emerge from any origin
- Background does not determine potential
- The gates we erect are often artificial
- Talent recognizes no social boundaries

### The Democratization Paradox

The film resolves a genuine tension: How do you maintain excellence while rejecting gatekeeping?

Gusteau's philosophy is NOT "everyone is already great." It IS "greatness is not predetermined by birth, class, or species." This is a crucial distinction. The film never suggests Remy succeeds because trying is enough. He succeeds because he has genuine talent AND works relentlessly to develop it.

**Transferable Principle:** Excellence is not inherited—it is cultivated. But cultivation requires access, and access requires opening doors that prejudice has locked.

## 2. Curiosity as Virtue

### Remy's Phenomenology of Taste

Remy doesn't just eat; he *experiences*. The film visualizes his gustatory consciousness through synesthetic animations—colors, shapes, music accompanying each flavor combination. His curiosity is not idle; it is a mode of deep attention.

**Three levels of Remy's curiosity:**

1. **Sensory**: He must taste everything. Compulsion, not choice.
2. **Combinatorial**: What happens when X meets Y? Pure experimentation.
3. **Philosophical**: Why do humans create? What is this drive?

### Curiosity as Ethical Imperative

The film positions Remy's curiosity not as mere preference but as his *nature*—what Aristotelians would call his *telos*. To deny his curiosity would be to deny himself.

This creates genuine moral stakes: When Django (Remy's father) shows him the rat poison display, he's not just warning about danger. He's making an argument: "This is what happens when you engage with the human world. Stay within your kind."

Remy's response is not rebellion for its own sake. It's a recognition that denying his nature would be a kind of self-betrayal. The film suggests that authentic expression—when it harms no one—carries moral weight.

**Transferable Principle:** Curiosity, when it constitutes your nature, becomes an obligation to yourself. Suppressing genuine curiosity is a form of self-harm.

## 3. The Outsider's Vision

### Fresh Eyes as Moral Advantage

Remy sees cooking differently because he IS different. The film makes his outsider status generative rather than merely deficient.

**What the outsider sees:**
- Rules that insiders accept as natural but are merely conventional
- Combinations that "shouldn't" work but do
- Inefficiencies hidden by tradition
- The joy that routine has buried

### The Productive Transgression

Every great dish Remy creates involves breaking a rule—often one the establishment has confused with a principle. The film distinguishes:

- **Principles**: Underlying truths (flavor balance, texture, freshness)
- **Rules**: Codified habits (who can cook, what combinations are allowed)

Remy violates rules while honoring principles. This is not mere iconoclasm—it's discernment.

**The paradox**: Remy deeply respects cooking tradition. He has memorized Gusteau's cookbook. His transgression comes from loving the art more than loving the boundaries erected around it.

**Transferable Principle:** Outsiders can see what insiders cannot—but only if they respect the domain enough to understand why the rules exist before breaking them.

## 4. Collaboration Models: Remy + Linguini

### Partnership Without Hierarchy

The Remy-Linguini relationship is the film's most complex innovation. It defies easy categorization:

- Not master/servant (neither controls the other permanently)
- Not equal partners (their capabilities differ radically)
- Not mentor/student (learning flows both directions)

### Complementary Capabilities

| Remy | Linguini |
|------|----------|
| Taste | Hands |
| Vision | Execution |
| Knowledge | Access |
| Conviction | Social navigation |

Neither succeeds alone. The film explicitly shows both trying and failing without the other.

### The Communication Problem

Much of the film's tension comes from the difficulty of translating between different modes of being. Remy cannot simply tell Linguini what to do—he must find a physical language (the hair-pulling mechanism) that bridges their radically different embodiments.

**Transferable Principle:** True collaboration requires inventing shared languages. Different capabilities can combine multiplicatively, not just additively—but only if each party accepts the legitimacy of what the other offers.

## 5. Ego's Transformation

### The Critic's Speech

Anton Ego's final review is the film's philosophical climax. It deserves careful attention:

> "In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is probably more meaningful than our criticism designating it so."

This is not anti-criticism. Ego remains a critic. But he recognizes the asymmetry between creation and judgment.

> "But there are times when a critic truly risks something, and that is in the discovery and defense of the new. The world is often unkind to new talent, new creations. The new needs friends."

### "The New Needs Friends"

This phrase captures something essential: genuine creativity is vulnerable. It requires protection, not just tolerance. The critic's role shifts from gatekeeper to gardener—cultivating what might flourish rather than merely culling what seems weak.

### Ego's Ratatouille Moment

The dish transports Ego to childhood—to his mother's kitchen. This is not sentimentality. It's recognition that great art connects us to something fundamental, something beneath the sophisticated defenses we've built.

The critic, for all his armor, remains a person capable of being moved. The film suggests this vulnerability is not weakness but the precondition for genuine aesthetic experience.

**Transferable Principle:** Criticism serves creation, not the reverse. The highest function of judgment is not rejection but recognition—the defense of authentic innovation against the inertia of convention.

## 6. Failure and Iteration

### Mistakes as Methodology

The film shows failures repeatedly:

- Remy's early experiments that don't work
- Linguini's initial disasters
- The soup that nearly ruins Gusteau's reputation
- The entire system's collapse when the secret is revealed

But failure in *Ratatouille* is never merely punitive. Each failure teaches:

### The Failure → Learning Loop

1. **Attempt**: Try something genuine
2. **Fail**: It doesn't work
3. **Reflect**: Why didn't it work?
4. **Adjust**: Change approach, not goal
5. **Attempt again**: With new understanding

### Failure is Not Defeat

The film distinguishes:
- **Failure**: A specific attempt that didn't succeed
- **Defeat**: Abandoning the endeavor entirely

Remy fails constantly. He is never defeated. The film suggests this persistence is not stubbornness but faith—faith in his own capacity and in the worth of the endeavor.

**Transferable Principle:** Failure is data. Defeat is a choice. Creative excellence requires the willingness to fail repeatedly while refusing defeat.

## 7. Success Factors: Why This Film Resonates

### Beyond "Follow Your Dreams"

Many children's films preach dream-following. *Ratatouille* succeeds because it takes the difficulties seriously:

**What the film acknowledges:**
- Some dreams are genuinely dangerous (rats in kitchens carry real risk)
- Talent is necessary, not just desire
- The world has real obstacles, not just misunderstandings
- Success may require sacrifice
- Not everyone will approve, ever

### Dual-Audience Appeal

The film works for children AND adults because:

**For children:**
- The fantasy is vivid and fun (a rat controlling a human!)
- The emotions are clear and strong
- The message is hopeful without being false

**For adults:**
- The philosophy is genuine, not diluted
- The obstacles are real, not easily overcome
- The ending is bittersweet (Gusteau's closes; the new restaurant is smaller but more honest)

### The Honest Ending

*Ratatouille* ends with Gusteau's restaurant closed. This is crucial. The film does not pretend that talent overcomes all. The world's prejudices have real consequences.

But it also ends with La Ratatouille—a smaller, humbler restaurant where rats and humans cook together openly. The film suggests that authentic success may look different from conventional success. Smaller, but truer.

**Transferable Principle:** Resonance requires honesty. Children are not deceived by false optimism—they sense it and discount it. True hope acknowledges difficulty while maintaining faith.

## 8. Synergies with "Little Kant"

### How Ratatouille Informs Philosophy Education for Children

A children's philosophy show faces the same challenges *Ratatouille* addresses:

| Challenge | Ratatouille's Approach | Application to Little Kant |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------------|
| Making difficult ideas accessible | Embody abstractions in vivid characters | Kant's categorical imperative becomes a lived dilemma, not a formula |
| Avoiding condescension | Trust the audience with real complexity | Don't simplify philosophy—dramatize it |
| Maintaining rigor | Never abandon standards while democratizing access | "Anyone can philosophize" doesn't mean all philosophies are equal |
| Creating genuine stakes | Remy could actually fail; his success isn't guaranteed | Philosophical questions should feel urgent, not academic |

### Specific Lessons

**1. Curiosity as Character Trait**
Remy's curiosity is not a message—it's his nature. Similarly, Little Kant's philosophers should embody their philosophies, not preach them. Kant doesn't lecture about duty; he IS dutiful. Diogenes doesn't explain cynicism; he lives it outrageously.

**2. The Outsider Advantage**
Children ARE outsiders to adult philosophical discourse. Like Remy, they can see what trained philosophers miss. The show should frame children's fresh perspective as an asset, not a deficit to be corrected.

**3. Collaboration Across Difference**
Remy and Linguini succeed because their differences are productive. Kant and Diogenes have radically different philosophies—but the show could model how philosophical disagreement is generative, not destructive.

**4. "The New Needs Friends"**
Ego's insight applies directly: children encountering philosophy for the first time need protection, not gatekeeping. The show should position itself as a friend to the child's emerging philosophical sensibility.

**5. Excellence Without Elitism**
Gusteau's motto applies: "Anyone can philosophize." But like cooking, philosophy requires cultivation. The show should communicate both that children can engage with real philosophy AND that philosophical skill develops through practice.

### A Proposed Synthesis

*Ratatouille*'s deepest lesson: **The urge to create is innate, but creation requires discipline. Curiosity is the seed; craft is the cultivation; excellence is the flower—which anyone, from anywhere, can grow.**

For Little Kant: **The urge to ask "why?" is innate, but philosophy requires discipline. Wonder is the seed; reasoning is the cultivation; wisdom is the flower—which anyone, from anywhere, can grow.**

## Transferable Principles Summary

1. **Excellence is cultivated, not inherited.** Background does not determine potential, but potential requires development.

2. **Curiosity, when it constitutes your nature, becomes an obligation.** Suppressing genuine curiosity is self-betrayal.

3. **Outsiders see what insiders cannot**—but only if they respect the domain enough to understand it before challenging it.

4. **True collaboration requires inventing shared languages.** Different capabilities combine multiplicatively when each party accepts the other's legitimacy.

5. **Criticism serves creation, not the reverse.** The highest judgment is recognition and defense, not rejection.

6. **Failure is data; defeat is a choice.** Excellence requires willingness to fail repeatedly while refusing defeat.

7. **Resonance requires honesty.** Children sense and discount false optimism. True hope acknowledges difficulty.

8. **"Anyone can cook" is not "everyone cooks equally."** Democratizing access to excellence is not abandoning standards.

9. **The new needs friends.** Genuine creativity is vulnerable and requires protection, not just tolerance.

10. **The urge to create and the urge to understand are the same urge.** Both are expressions of the fundamental human (and rat) drive to engage authentically with the world.
