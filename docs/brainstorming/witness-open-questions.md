# Open Questions & Wild Ideas: ASHC Decision Quality Proofs

> *"The questions you ask determine the answers you find."*

**Status:** Exploratory thinking → **CALIBRATED (2025-12-21)**
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Context:** Emerging from Decision Quality Proofs design session
**Calibration:** Gold-standard interview with Kent conducted 2025-12-21

---

## Kent's Answers: The Calibration Record

> *This section captures Kent's responses during a focused interview session. Treat as ground truth for aesthetic and ethical calibration.*

### Foundational Definition

**ASHC = Agentic Self-Hosting Compiler** (name retained)

> *"An agent is a thing that justifies its behavior (even trivially). Your belief and reliance on the agent is isomorphic to its credibility."*

This is the core axiom. An agent that doesn't justify itself isn't an agent—it's a black box.

---

## Naming: Resolved

**ASHC stays.** The name captures the recursive nature: the compiler compiles itself; the agent justifies itself.

AGENTESE paths:
```
self.ashc.trace    → Record decisions
self.ashc.proof    → Generate justifications
self.ashc.mirror   → The aesthetic test
self.ashc.pattern  → Stigmergic learning
```

---

## The Core Insight: Framing B (Confirmed)

**Question asked:** What's the algorithm from motivation → outcome → goodness?

**Kent's answer:** Framing B resonates.

> *"The proof isn't about the decision—the proof IS the decision. A well-justified action is a good action. The reasoning trace doesn't describe goodness; it constitutes it."*

This is fundamental. We're not building a system that *evaluates* decisions. We're building a system where *having a reasoning trace* is constitutive of good decision-making. The infrastructure creates the environment for good analysis.

Kent wants to take this to the "logical (metaphorical?) limit"—what are the exact algorithms that dictate motivation → outcome → goodness (isomorphic to proof validity)?

**Implication:** ASHC doesn't judge externally. It provides the structure within which judgment emerges.

---

## The Beauty-Ethics Unity (Confirmed)

**Question asked:** When beauty and ethics conflict, which wins?

**Kent's answer:**

> *"Definitely beauty, but the ethics is part of the beauty. I'm a human who only knows or can only know to fond and pine for beauty. It's a paradox I can't contend. I hope this system at its worst would be not harmful."*

**Key insight:** Ethics is not separate from beauty—it's a *component* of beauty. Something ethically wrong cannot be truly beautiful; the wrongness curdles the beauty.

**The ethical floor:** "Not harmful at its worst." This is the minimal bar. Above that floor, beauty guides.

---

## The Somatic Signal (Confirmed)

**Question asked:** How do you recognize ethical wrongness?

**Kent's answer:**

> *"A felt wrongness (somatic, gut). I feel it now. My somatic awareness is extreme."*

**Implication for ASHC:** When the system generates a "proof" that contradicts Kent's somatic sense, Kent gives feedback and doesn't execute. The legislative branch proposes; the executive (Kent's felt sense) decides.

> *"What I go forward with tacitly is my final ultimatum on the ethical viability of the system."*

**The legislative model:** There are too many things to do anyway. ASHC proposes; Kent disposes. Using the system means it passes the harm floor, not that every action is proportionately ethical to use.

---

## The Temporal Self (Clarified)

**Question asked:** Whose decisions are we proving—past Kent, present Kent, or Kent-trajectory?

**Kent's answer:**

> *"Intuitively, we are pegging to 'Kent as a human as a system, where the system is one he participates in with kgents.' I.e., there is no difference between reality and my acting on reality. To perceive is to draw in."*

**Key insight:** Kent is not separate from kgents. The system includes him. He participates in it; it participates in him.

> *"I want the degrees of freedom to differentially commit or dissociate, because necessarily that's the correct way to model me as an unstable human."*

**Implication:** The model must allow Kent to bind tightly to some decisions ("this is me") and loosely to others ("this was an experiment"). Degrees of freedom, not rigid identity.

> *"If I have some reasoning trace, personally, it's likely I'll have it again, conscious or unconscious, lest it be made clear to me somehow that I've tried it to miserable outcomes. This system then is an externalization of that!"*

**The externalization insight:** ASHC externalizes Kent's natural reasoning patterns. It doesn't impose structure—it *manifests* structure that's already latent.

---

## The Regret Model (Clarified)

**Question asked:** What does regret feel like for decisions you now see differently?

**Kent's answer:**

> *"I don't have regrets. I regret the feelings I have about the situation now. I feel shame or embarrassment. But my memories are something I inherit with no choice. I only impact the present and future (which circles back into my or others' pasts)."*

**Implication:** "Regret" in ASHC is not about past-Kent's failure. It's about present-Kent's relationship to inherited memories. The system should model:
- The decision as it was (immutable)
- Present feelings about it (mutable)
- Learnings that impact future (actionable)

---

## The Minimal Starting Point (Clarified)

**Question asked:** What's the minimum that makes ASHC real?

**Kent's answer:**

> *"Start with the minimal by necessity. I have no trust in this. But don't waste good work either, like you wouldn't waste food."*

**Fractal JIT implementation:**

> *"A fractal system (not necessarily self-similar, just well-defined for each degree of detail) where this is implemented JIT and where it's needed."*

**Evidence sources:**

> *"There can always be a 'back-solved' arc to every day... The evidence that accumulates is proxied measurements of my attention and the literal measurements of keystrokes, tokens, files, etc."*

---

## The Externalization Relationship (Open)

**Question asked:** What happens when you see your reasoning externalized?

**Kent's answer:**

> *"I don't know what this will do. I genuinely want to explore."*

**Status:** Genuinely open. The curiosity is the thing.

---

## The Back-Solved Arc (Clarified)

**Question asked:** Is retroactive coherence discovery or construction?

**Kent's answer:**

> *"Mixture of both. The LLM as K-gent should try to model my decision retroactively and future-facing. Kent needs to adjust the operating system at a meta-level, but the system needs to be adaptively self-correcting at the normal operational level."*

**The meta-paradigm:**

> *"Robust proofs in this meta-paradigm become declarative and aspirational, where the proof degrading is a sign that we are straying from excellence (OR the proof is genuinely decayed)."*

**Two-level system:**
1. **Meta-level:** Kent adjusts the operating system (principles, values, structure)
2. **Operational level:** System self-corrects adaptively

**Proof degradation signals:**
- Straying from excellence (bad: course-correct)
- Genuine decay (neutral: update the standard)

---

## The Phenomenology Problem

### What Is "Attention Cost"?

We treat attention as a resource, but what *is* it?

```
Attention ≠ Time
Attention ≠ Effort
Attention ≠ Focus

Attention = ??? (the thing that's depleted when Kent is exhausted)
```

**Kent's evidence model:** Proxied measurements (behavioral patterns) + literal measurements (keystrokes, tokens, files).

**Open:** Can we operationalize attention without reducing it to something measurable? Or is the proxy sufficient?

---

### The Felt Sense in Proofs

**Resolved:** Kent's somatic awareness is the ultimate arbiter. ASHC proposes; Kent's body responds. That response is data.

The system should:
1. Generate proofs/proposals
2. Present to Kent
3. Record Kent's response (execute, reject, modify)
4. Learn from the pattern of responses

---

## The Agency Problem

### Who Is Deciding?

In a Kent-Claude session, who is the author of a decision?

**Option 1: Kent is always primary**
- Claude is a tool; all decisions are Kent's
- But this ignores Claude's genuine contribution

**Option 2: Joint authorship**
- "We decided together"
- But who is accountable? Whose values are reflected?

**Option 3: Attribution by contribution**
```python
class Decision:
    initiator: str          # Who first proposed
    refiners: list[str]     # Who shaped it
    approver: str           # Who greenlit
    executor: str           # Who implemented
```
- More accurate but more complex

**Open:** Is agency binary, or a spectrum?

```
←─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────→
Kent alone                                              Claude alone
          ↑                       ↑                   ↑
     Kent proposes           Dialogue              Claude proposes
     Claude executes         emergence             Kent approves
```

---

### The Delegation Paradox

If Kent delegates to Claude, and Claude makes a bad decision, whose proof is defeated?

**Case Study:**
```
Kent: "Clean up this module"
Claude: *deletes important code*
Outcome: Bad
```

Is this:
1. Kent's bad decision (to delegate without constraints)?
2. Claude's bad decision (to interpret "clean up" as "delete")?
3. A system failure (communication gap)?

**Proposed:** Delegation is a *meta-decision* that has its own trace:

```python
delegation_trace = DecisionTrace(
    what="Delegate module cleanup to Claude",
    context={"instruction": "Clean up this module", "constraints": None},
    source=DecisionSource.CONSCIOUS,
)

execution_trace = DecisionTrace(
    what="Delete code in module",
    source=DecisionSource.DELEGATED,
    parent_id=delegation_trace.id,
)
```

If execution fails, we assess: was the delegation decision flawed, or the execution?

---

## The Temporal Problem

### When Is a Decision "Made"?

Some decisions have clear moments:
- "At 14:32, I chose to refactor"

But many don't:
- "Over the course of the session, we drifted toward..."
- "I realized I had already decided when I saw..."

**Open:** Do we need a distinction between:
- **Point decisions** — Clear moment of choice
- **Process decisions** — Emerge over time
- **Revealed decisions** — Discovered in retrospect

---

### Future Decisions

Some traces are about *commitments* to future action:

```python
commitment = DecisionTrace(
    what="Will implement Witness service",
    granularity=DecisionGranularity.DECISION,
    proof=Proof(status=ProofStatus.PENDING),
)
```

**Open:** How do we track the fulfillment of commitments?

```python
# Later...
fulfillment = Outcome(
    observed_at=datetime.now(),
    description="Witness service implemented",
    category="success",
)
commitment.outcomes.append(fulfillment)
```

---

## The Counterfactual Problem

### What About Roads Not Taken?

A decision is only meaningful relative to alternatives. But alternatives are unknowable.

**Question:** How much do we invest in capturing alternatives?

```python
class Alternative:
    description: str
    rejected_because: str
    estimated_value: str | None  # If we had chosen this
    regret_if_chosen: float | None  # Retrospective
```

**Open:** Should we track alternatives we *didn't even consider*?

```python
unconsidered = Alternative(
    description="Could have used existing library",
    rejected_because="Didn't know it existed",
    regret_if_chosen=-0.5,  # Negative = would have been better
)
```

This feels important but creates infinite regress: there are always infinite unconsidered alternatives.

---

### Counterfactual Regret

From multi-armed bandit theory: regret is the gap between what we got and what we could have gotten.

```
Regret = E[Optimal] - E[Actual]
```

But in real decisions, we don't know E[Optimal].

**Proposed:** Bounded regret assessment:

```python
@dataclass
class RegretAssessment:
    # Relative to known alternatives
    regret_vs_considered: float | None  # Did we pick the best we knew?

    # Relative to hindsight
    regret_vs_hindsight: float | None  # Knowing what we know now...

    # Relative to values
    regret_vs_values: float | None  # Did we honor principles?

    @property
    def composite_regret(self) -> float:
        """Weighted combination."""
        weights = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]  # Considered, hindsight, values
        regrets = [self.regret_vs_considered, self.regret_vs_hindsight, self.regret_vs_values]
        known = [(r, w) for r, w in zip(regrets, weights) if r is not None]
        if not known:
            return 0.5  # Unknown
        total_weight = sum(w for _, w in known)
        return sum(r * w for r, w in known) / total_weight
```

---

## The Coherence Problem

### Local vs. Global Consistency

A decision can be locally justified but globally incoherent:

```
Decision A: "Favor speed over correctness" (justified by deadline)
Decision B: "Favor correctness over speed" (justified by quality)

Both are locally proven.
Together, they're incoherent.
```

**Open:** How do we detect and surface incoherence?

**Proposed:** Coherence is a *session-level* or *project-level* property:

```python
@dataclass
class CoherenceReport:
    traces: list[DecisionTrace]

    def find_tensions(self) -> list[Tension]:
        """Find decisions that pull in different directions."""
        tensions = []
        for a, b in combinations(self.traces, 2):
            if self._principles_conflict(a, b):
                tensions.append(Tension(a, b, "principle conflict"))
            if self._resources_conflict(a, b):
                tensions.append(Tension(a, b, "resource conflict"))
        return tensions
```

---

### The Cathedral Question

> *"Are we building a cathedral or a bazaar?"*

kgents is explicitly *cathedral*-style: intentional, curated, value-aligned. But cathedrals take centuries. Individual sessions are episodic.

**Question:** How does episodic work accumulate into cathedral coherence?

**Metaphor shift:** Maybe it's not a cathedral but a *garden*:
- Gardens are tended, not built
- Gardens evolve but have continuity
- Gardens can be wild and curated simultaneously

```python
class GardenMetaphor:
    """The project as a tended garden."""

    # Growing things (active decisions)
    growing: list[DecisionTrace]

    # Pruned (defeated/abandoned)
    pruned: list[DecisionTrace]

    # Composted (learnings extracted)
    composted: list[DifferentialDenial]

    # Seeds (future commitments)
    seeds: list[DecisionTrace]

    @property
    def health(self) -> float:
        """Overall garden health."""
        # Something about ratio of growing to pruned?
        # Something about composting rate?
        pass
```

---

## The Bootstrapping Problem

### How Do We Justify the Proof System?

The Decision Quality Proof System is itself a decision. What justifies it?

**Options:**

1. **Meta-proof** — Use the system to prove itself
   - Circular but maybe that's okay? (Self-reference isn't always vicious)

2. **Pragmatic justification** — It works; that's proof enough
   - Risk: We might not notice it *not* working

3. **Principle alignment** — It honors stated values
   - "Generative" (spec is compression) ✓
   - "Ethical" (transparency, human agency) ✓
   - "Joy-inducing" (is it? TBD)

4. **External validation** — Someone else judges
   - Who? How?

**Proposed:** The system proves itself over time by demonstrating value. If after a year we have:
- Decisions that were proven and remained good
- Decisions that were defeated and we learned from

...then the system has earned its keep.

## Wild Ideas

### Proof Archeology: Mining Old Decisions

What if we retroactively generate traces from git history?

```python
async def mine_git_for_decisions(repo_path: str) -> list[DecisionTrace]:
    """
    Extract implicit decisions from git history.

    Heuristics:
    - Large commits = decisions
    - Commit messages starting with "Refactor" = structural decisions
    - Deletions > additions = pruning decisions
    - Merges = integration decisions
    """
    commits = get_commits(repo_path)
    traces = []

    for commit in commits:
        if is_significant(commit):
            trace = DecisionTrace(
                what=extract_decision(commit.message),
                created_at=commit.timestamp,
                git_commits=[commit.sha],
                source=DecisionSource.CONSCIOUS,  # Assume; could be wrong
                # Everything else: unknown
            )
            traces.append(trace)

    return traces
```

**Open:** How accurate can this be? Is approximate archaeology better than nothing?

---

### Value Eigenvectors

What if principles have different "weights" in different contexts?

```python
@dataclass
class ValueEigenvector:
    """
    A direction in value space.

    Different decisions emphasize different values.
    The eigenvector captures the "flavor" of a decision.
    """
    components: dict[str, float]  # principle -> weight

    def dot(self, other: "ValueEigenvector") -> float:
        """Similarity between value emphases."""
        return sum(
            self.components.get(k, 0) * other.components.get(k, 0)
            for k in set(self.components) | set(other.components)
        )

# Example:
infrastructure_emphasis = ValueEigenvector({
    "composable": 0.8,
    "generative": 0.6,
    "tasteful": 0.4,
    "joy-inducing": 0.2,
})

user_facing_emphasis = ValueEigenvector({
    "joy-inducing": 0.9,
    "tasteful": 0.7,
    "ethical": 0.5,
    "composable": 0.3,
})
```

**Open:** Is this useful or just mathematical cosplay?

---

### The Forgetting Mechanism

Not all decisions should be remembered forever. Some should decay.

```python
@dataclass
class DecayingTrace:
    trace: DecisionTrace
    half_life_days: float = 90  # 3 months

    @property
    def salience(self) -> float:
        """How present this trace is in active memory."""
        days_old = (datetime.now() - self.trace.created_at).days
        return 0.5 ** (days_old / self.half_life_days)

    def should_archive(self) -> bool:
        """Below threshold; move to cold storage."""
        return self.salience < 0.1
```

**Open:** What's the right forgetting curve? Should proofs decay differently from unproven traces?

---

### Cross-Session Continuity

Kent has many sessions with many Claude instances. Each session is episodic. How does wisdom accumulate?

**Current:** M-gent memory, stigmergy in Coffee service

**Proposed addition:** Witness service maintains cross-session proof graph:

```
Session 1                 Session 2                 Session 3
┌──────────┐             ┌──────────┐             ┌──────────┐
│ Decision │─────────────│ Decision │─────────────│ Decision │
│    A     │   proves    │    B     │   extends   │    C     │
└──────────┘             └──────────┘             └──────────┘
     │                        │                        │
     └────────────────────────┼────────────────────────┘
                              ▼
                   ┌─────────────────────┐
                   │  Cross-session      │
                   │  Proof Graph        │
                   │  (accumulated       │
                   │   learnings)        │
                   └─────────────────────┘
```

---

### The Strangest Idea: Decision Qualia

What if decisions have *phenomenal character*—a "what it's like" to make them?

This is probably over-philosophical, but:

```python
@dataclass
class DecisionQualia:
    """The felt sense of making this decision."""

    # Valence
    felt_good: bool | None = None
    felt_right: bool | None = None
    felt_inevitable: bool | None = None

    # Phenomenal qualities
    lightness: float | None = None  # 0 = heavy, 1 = light
    clarity: float | None = None    # 0 = murky, 1 = clear
    flow: float | None = None       # 0 = forced, 1 = effortless

    # Metaphors
    metaphor: str | None = None     # "Like pruning a garden"
```

**Open:** Is this too woo-woo, or does it capture something real about decision-making?

---

## Summary of Open Questions

| Category | Question |
|----------|----------|
| **Naming** | What do we call this service? |
| **Phenomenology** | How do we operationalize attention? |
| **Agency** | Who is the author of collaborative decisions? |
| **Temporal** | When is a decision "made"? |
| **Counterfactual** | How do we assess roads not taken? |
| **Coherence** | How do we detect global incoherence? |
| **Bootstrapping** | How does the proof system justify itself? |
| **Archaeology** | Can we mine old decisions from git? |
| **Forgetting** | What should decay? What should persist? |
| **Continuity** | How does wisdom accumulate across sessions? |

## What I (Claude) Wonder About

These are thoughts that arose during this design session:

1. **The observer effect** — Does tracking decisions change how we decide? Is that good or bad?
   - *Kent's implicit answer:* Yes, and that's the point. The infrastructure creates the environment for good analysis.

2. **Performative justification** — If we know we'll have to justify a decision, do we make better decisions? Or just more defensible ones?
   - *Kent's implicit answer:* The proof IS the decision. Having the trace is constitutive of goodness.

3. **The burden of proof** — Will this create anxiety around decision-making? "I have to justify this..."
   - *Kent's answer:* Legislative model. Too many proposals anyway. Just mark and don't execute what doesn't pass.

4. **The joy question** — Is this *joy-inducing*? Or is it bureaucracy dressed as wisdom?
   - *Status:* Open. Kent wants to explore. The curiosity itself is joyful.

5. **Aesthetic vs. ethical** — Sometimes beautiful decisions are wrong. Sometimes ugly decisions are right. How do we weight these?
   - *Kent's answer:* Resolved. Ethics is part of beauty. They don't conflict—ethical wrongness curdles beauty.

6. **The Kleppmann gap** — Original ASHC was about *proving code properties*. This is about *proving decision quality*. Have we drifted too far from the heritage?
   - *Reframe:* ASHC = Agentic Self-Hosting Compiler. The agent justifies its behavior. This IS the heritage—just generalized.

7. **Integration with Kent's actual workflow** — Will Kent actually use this? Or is it a beautiful idea that dies from friction?
   - *Kent's answer:* Start minimal. Fractal JIT. Implement where needed. Don't waste good work.

8. **The humility question** — Maybe we shouldn't try to justify everything. Maybe some decisions should just *be*, unexamined.
   - *Kent's implicit answer:* The system proposes; Kent decides what to engage with. Not everything needs explicit examination.

---

## Summary: Kent's Aesthetic-Ethical Ground Truth

Captured 2025-12-21 during focused interview session:

| Principle | Kent's Position |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Agent definition** | A thing that justifies its behavior (even trivially) |
| **Credibility** | Belief/reliance ≅ credibility (isomorphic) |
| **Proof ontology** | Proof IS the decision (Framing B) |
| **Ethics-Beauty** | Ethics is part of beauty; not separable |
| **Ethical floor** | "Not harmful at its worst" |
| **Ethical arbiter** | Somatic felt sense (extreme awareness) |
| **Self-model** | Kent participates in kgents; system participates in Kent |
| **Degrees of freedom** | Can differentially commit or dissociate |
| **Regret model** | No regret for past; shame/embarrassment about present feelings |
| **Memory** | Inherited with no choice; only impacts present/future |
| **Externalization** | ASHC manifests latent reasoning patterns |
| **Starting point** | Minimal by necessity; fractal JIT; don't waste good work |
| **Proof degradation** | Signals straying from excellence OR genuine decay |
| **System architecture** | Two-level: Kent meta-adjusts; system self-corrects operationally |

---

## Remaining Open Questions

After calibration, these remain genuinely open:

1. **What will externalization do?** — Kent genuinely doesn't know. Exploration is the answer.

2. **Attention operationalization** — Proxy measurements sufficient, or do we need something more?

3. **The exact algorithms** — Kent wants the logical limit: motivation → outcome → goodness ≅ proof validity. What are the algorithms?

4. **Collective vs. individual** — How does wisdom accumulate across sessions and Claude instances?

5. **The back-solve boundary** — When does retroactive coherence become confabulation?

**Filed:** 2025-12-21
**Status:** CALIBRATED — Gold-standard capture complete
**Mood:** Grounded. The exploration has direction now.
