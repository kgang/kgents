# Gallery

Welcome to the kgents Gallery - a curated collection of interactive examples showcasing the power and elegance of agent-oriented programming.

## Philosophy

> "An agent is a morphism A → B. Everything else is added via Halo."

The Gallery demonstrates kgents' core principles:

- **Composability**: Agents are morphisms that compose predictably
- **Functors**: Lift agents to new contexts (Maybe, Flux, etc.)
- **Personality**: Soul governance ensures aligned responses
- **Tasteful design**: Quality over quantity, always

## Featured Examples

## Quick Start

All examples are interactive and runnable. Each page includes:

1. **Concept**: The core idea explained clearly
2. **Code**: Working examples you can run
3. **Exercises**: Hands-on challenges to deepen understanding

To run any example:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/kentgang/kgents.git
cd kgents

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run an example
python -m impl.claude.agents.examples.hello_world
```

## Learning Path

New to kgents? Follow this sequence:

1. **Hello World** - Understand the Agent[A, B] pattern
2. **Composition** - Learn to chain agents with >>
3. **Functors** - Handle edge cases elegantly
4. **Soul Dialogue** - Add personality to your agents
5. **Streaming** - Process continuous flows
6. **Custom Archetype** - Build production systems

## Interactive Playground

For hands-on experimentation, try the CLI playground:

```bash
# Interactive tutorials
kgents play hello        # Start with hello world
kgents play compose      # Learn composition
kgents play functor      # Explore functors
kgents play soul         # Meet K-gent

# REPL environment
kgents play repl         # Experimental sandbox
```
