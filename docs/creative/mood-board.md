## Part II: Conceptual Inspiration

### The Garden Metaphor

kgents is a garden, not a factory.

**Reference Images** (search these concepts):
- Japanese zen gardens — restraint, raked patterns, intentional emptiness
- English cottage gardens — controlled wildness, biodiversity
- Greenhouse cultivation — care, growth stages, nurturing
- Forest floor — decay and renewal, the Accursed Share

**What to take:**
- Seasons (phases, entropy)
- Cultivation (care over time)
- Biodiversity (many agent types)
- Paths (navigation, discovery)
- Weeds (some chaos is welcome)

### The Crystal Metaphor

Memory and knowledge as crystalline structures.

**Reference Images:**
- Crystal lattices — ordered complexity
- Geodes — rough exterior, beautiful interior
- Snowflakes — unique yet following rules
- Bismuth crystals — rainbow iridescence, stair-step growth

**What to take:**
- Facets (multiple perspectives)
- Growth (accretion over time)
- Refraction (light plays differently)
- Fractal structure (self-similarity)

### The Observatory Metaphor

Seeing patterns in complexity.

**Reference Images:**
- Astronomical observatories — quiet power, looking deep
- Telescope views — zooming through scales
- Star maps — navigation through complexity
- Control rooms — many signals, focused attention

**What to take:**
- Semantic zoom (scales of detail)
- Quiet environment (focus)
- Instrument precision (tools that work)
- Wonder at scale (appreciation for complexity)

## Part III: Color Inspiration

### Dark Mode Palettes

**Base:** Deep blue-black (`#0F172A` slate-900)

**Accent families:**
```
Cyan family:     #06B6D4 → #0891B2 → #0E7490
                 (knowledge, brain, understanding)

Green family:    #22C55E → #16A34A → #15803D
                 (growth, health, gestalt)

Amber family:    #F59E0B → #D97706 → #B45309
                 (creativity, warmth, atelier)

Violet family:   #8B5CF6 → #7C3AED → #6D28D9
                 (synthesis, collaboration, coalition)

Pink family:     #EC4899 → #DB2777 → #BE185D
                 (drama, narrative, park)
```

## Part IV: Typography Inspiration

### The Inter Character

Inter is kgents' primary typeface. Its character:
- Neutral but not cold
- Highly readable at small sizes
- Designed for screens
- Variable weight enables fluid hierarchy

**Reference:** [rsms.me/inter](https://rsms.me/inter/)

### Code Typography

JetBrains Mono for all code and data:
- Distinguished from body text
- Ligatures for operators
- Personality in technical contexts

**Reference:** [jetbrains.com/lp/mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)

---

## Part V: Motion Inspiration

### Breathing Animation

Reference: Human breathing rhythm
- Inhale: ~2s
- Exhale: ~2s
- Natural pause at each end
- Sinusoidal, not linear

**Implementation:** `components/joy/Breathe.tsx`

### Organic Timing

Reference: Natural movement
- Leaves rustling — irregular rhythm
- Water flowing — smooth with variation
- Birds taking flight — quick start, smooth glide

**Not mechanical** — Avoid perfectly regular intervals

### Celebration

Reference: Confetti, fireworks, applause
- Earned, not gratuitous
- Brief (300-500ms peak)
- Disperses naturally

**Reference research:** [Micro Animation Examples 2025](https://bricxlabs.com/blogs/micro-interactions-2025-examples)

---

## Part VI: Sound Inspiration

*(Future consideration—kgents is currently silent)*

If we add sound:
- **Ambient:** Soft, unobtrusive, natural
- **Feedback:** Subtle clicks, organic not mechanical
- **Alerts:** Musical, not jarring
- **Optional:** Always off by default

Reference: [A Soft Murmur](https://asoftmurmur.com/) — ambient sound that doesn't intrude

---

## Part VII: Anti-Inspiration

Things kgents should **not** feel like:

| Anti-Reference | Why Avoid |
|----------------|-----------|
| Corporate dashboards | Dense, cold, overwhelming |
| Gaming UIs | Over-stimulating, distracting |
| Social media feeds | Addictive patterns, attention theft |
| Enterprise software | Feature creep, no personality |
| Generic SaaS | Forgettable, no character |

### Specific Anti-Patterns

- **Notification spam** — Respect attention
- **Dark patterns** — Honest affordances only
- **Gamification for engagement** — Joy is authentic, not manipulative
- **Gradient overload** — Restraint in decoration
- **Skeleton screens everywhere** — Sometimes patience messaging is better

---

## Part VIII: Sensory Summary

### If kgents were a place:
A well-lit study in a house surrounded by gardens. Books on shelves, warm light, a window overlooking growing things. Quiet but not silent. Tools within reach but not cluttered.

### If kgents were music:
Ambient electronic with organic textures. Think Brian Eno meets Tycho. Contemplative but not soporific. Structured but breathing.

### If kgents were a material:
Warm wood and cool glass. The wood is where you rest your hands; the glass is where you see clearly. Both honest materials.

### If kgents were weather:
Golden hour on a spring evening. Warm light, gentle breeze, everything growing. Not too hot, not too cold. Perfect for sitting outside and thinking.
