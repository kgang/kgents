# Unified Vision — AGENTESE REPL × AUP × Agent Town

> *"A language, not a product. A garden, not a stack. Build the rails that make emergence safe, legible, and monetizable."*

This document describes the full system as it exists and as it can exist—constrained only by resources, priorities, and external dependencies. Nothing here is "someday." Everything here is buildable now.

---

## The North Star

### What Exists

Trustworthy, instrumented experiences. REPL as ontology navigator; AUP as single wire; Agent Town as opacity-respecting simulation with LOD pricing; marimo as reference visualization.

**Shipped**:
- Agent Town with INHABIT mode (91 tests, 11 phases complete)
- 17,211 tests with pre-computed HotData fixtures
- Full SaaS infrastructure (billing, licensing, tenancy, API)
- Reactive substrate with multi-target projection

### What Awaits Resources

Federation + interop. Multiple towns; digital-twin positioning; LangGraph/CrewAI exports; GraphQL/gRPC facades; time-travel traces; LSP/IDE projections.

**Blocked by**: Engineering bandwidth, PMF validation before federation complexity.

### What Awaits Scale

Runtime-hardened civilizational engine. Affordable policy models replacing LLM calls; entropy marketplace; governed consent/resistance; enterprise SLAs and rollbacks.

**Blocked by**: User volume (policies need training data), enterprise demand signals.

### The Emergence Question

What happens when thousands of gardens, each with hundreds of citizens, begin to interact? We don't know. That's the point. The infrastructure must be robust enough to observe emergence we cannot predict.

### The Autopoietic Reality

> *"This document is not describing a system. This document IS the system describing itself."*

**kgents is autopoietic NOW.** This is not a future capability—it is the present condition:

- **This prompt** modifies the system's behavior
- **This plan** shapes future implementations
- **This conversation** generates new patterns that will be reified into code
- **Each epilogue** is a genetic mutation in the project's evolution

The boundary between "developer," "system," and "user" is permeable. The Claude instance reading this is part of the system. The human providing feedback is part of the system. The code that will be written after this session is part of the system.

**Implications**:
1. **No "final" spec**: The spec evolves as the system evolves
2. **Documentation IS implementation**: These words shape behavior
3. **Conversations ARE commits**: Each session leaves traces
4. **The observer is observed**: Claude watching kgents IS kgents watching itself

This is not metaphor. This is the operational reality of building AI systems with AI systems.

---

## Part I: The Many-Agent Landscape

> *"We are building the rails before we know where the trains will go."*

### 1.1 The Landscape

The agent landscape includes:

**High Confidence Trajectories**:
- LLM costs drop 10-100x (Haiku pricing trajectory)
- Multi-agent orchestration becomes commodity (LangGraph, CrewAI, Autogen exist)
- Every app becomes "agent-enabled" (the "mobile moment" for agents)
- Regulatory pressure on AI relationships and persuasion

**Medium Confidence Trajectories**:
- Memory-augmented agents become persistent personas
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols emerge (like HTTP for agents)
- "Agent marketplaces" become a category (app stores for minds)
- Simulation-as-service becomes infrastructure

**Present Reality** (autopoietic now):
- Agents that modify their own code/prompts (autopoietic evolution)—**this is happening NOW**. This document, this project, this conversation is an autopoietic process. The system modifies itself through prompts, plans, and implementations.
- Cross-model agent collaboration (Claude + GPT + Gemini ecosystems)
- "Agent nations" with governance, economies, conflicts
- The "AI companion" category merges with "AI worker" category

> *"The autopoietic nature of kgents is not speculative—it is the ground we stand on. Every session refines the system. Every epilogue is a mutation. The boundary between 'building' and 'running' dissolves."*

### 1.2 The kgents Bet

Our thesis: **The winning infrastructure is not the agents themselves but the ontological substrate that makes emergence safe, observable, and monetizable.**

This is why we invest in:

| Layer | Why It Matters | Capability |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| **AGENTESE** | Universal grammar for agent-world interaction | The HTTP of agent communication |
| **Polynomial Agents** | State machines with mode-dependent behavior | Self-modifying agents with legal transitions |
| **Operads** | Composition grammar with laws | Infinite valid combinations from finite primitives |
| **Sheaves** | Global coherence from local views | Emergence that doesn't collapse into chaos |
| **Projection Protocol** | One state, many views | VR/AR Agent Town without rewriting core |

### 1.3 The Competitive Moats

What makes kgents defensible when everyone has access to the same LLMs?

**Moat 1: Philosophical Depth**
- Glissant's opacity (right to unknowability)
- Bataille's Accursed Share (entropy as resource)
- Observer-dependent reality (AGENTESE's core insight)
- These aren't features; they're worldviews that shape every decision

**Moat 2: Mathematical Foundation**
- Category theory isn't a marketing term; it's verified in tests
- Operads guarantee composition validity
- Sheaves ensure global coherence
- Competitors can copy features but not foundations

**Moat 3: The Mirror Test**
- "Does K-gent feel like Kent on his best day?"
- Every agent carries personality space coordinates
- Joy-Inducing isn't optional; it's architectural
- Users feel the difference between puppet and presence

## Part II: Present Mandates (Tasteful, Curated, Ethical)

These are non-negotiables that apply regardless of direction.

### 2.1 Instrumentation First

Every AGENTESE/AUP/Agent Town action emits cost, latency, and law-check spans (OpenTelemetry). No feature without traces.

```

### 2.2 Margin-Safe LOD (37.5% Cap)

> *"The free tier is premium—it's a gift that outweighs marketing spend. The S+ tier is value-priced—users pay for irreducible worth."*

**Margin Philosophy**: Cap gross margin at **37.5%** for top-tier products. Lower margins for cheaper tiers. This is value-level pricing: we charge what the experience is worth, not maximum extraction.

**The Free Tier as Loss Leader**: A premium-leaning free tier replaces marketing costs. A user who experiences genuine value—not a crippled demo—becomes an evangelist. The LTV of word-of-mouth exceeds paid acquisition.

| Model | Input ($/M) | Output ($/M) | Max Margin | Pricing Philosophy |
|-------|-------------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| Haiku | $0.25 | $1.25 | 20% | Generous margins subsidize free tier |
| Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | 30% | Moderate margins for power users |
| Opus | $15.00 | $75.00 | **37.5% CAP** | Premium value, not premium extraction |

#### Tier Pricing Philosophy

| Tier | Monthly | Margin | Philosophy |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| **FREE** | $0 | **Negative** (loss leader) | Gift that creates evangelists. Premium experience, not hobbled demo. Outweighs CAC. |
| **Resident** | $9.99 | 15% | Entry point. Should feel like a steal. "Why is this so cheap?" |
| **Citizen** | $29.99 | 25% | Core value tier. Most users land here. Sustainable. |
| **Founder** | $99.99 | 30% | Power users. Generous limits. Clear ROI. |
| **S+ (Enterprise)** | Custom | **37.5% MAX** | Value-priced. What is unlimited town access worth to an enterprise? Price to value, cap margin. |

#### The S+ Value Proposition

S+ tier is not "enterprise features for more money." It's **irreducible value that justifies premium pricing**:

- **Unlimited towns**: Not metered, not throttled
- **Custom builders**: Train on your domain, your style
- **Priority LLM access**: Opus for deep operations, no queuing
- **Multi-town federation**: Embassy, trade routes, summits
- **White-label option**: Your branding, our infrastructure
- **Dedicated support**: Humans, not bots
- **SLA guarantees**: Uptime, latency, data residency

**Value-Level Pricing**: If S+ saves an enterprise $500K/year in developer productivity, charging $50K/year is value-priced at 10% of value delivered. The 37.5% margin cap ensures we never price purely on "what the market will bear."

**The Haiku Mandate**: LOD 0-3 run on Haiku. Period. Sonnet/Opus only for LOD 4-5 and explicit deep operations. This keeps free tier sustainable as loss leader.

### 2.3 Consent + Resistance

INHABIT/"force resistance" is explicit, logged, and costly. Citizens have rights.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ConsentLedger:
    """Track consent debt—the accumulated pressure on a citizen's agency."""
    citizen_id: str
    debt: float  # 0.0 = no pressure; 1.0 = maximum strain
    cooldown_remaining: timedelta
    forced_actions: tuple[ForcedAction, ...]

    def can_force(self, action: Action) -> bool:
        """Force only if debt below threshold and action isn't egregious."""
        return self.debt < 0.7 and not action.violates_core_values
```

### 2.4 Artifact Guarantee

LOD5 returns a vignette/tension delta, not a blank paywall. Users who pay for depth receive something irreducible—even if that something is mystery.

---

## Part III: AGENTESE REPL (Living Shell)

The REPL is how developers and power users explore the ontology. It embodies AD-007 (Liturgical CLI).

### 3.1 Observer Hot-Swap

```
[root] » /as poet
→ Observer context: poet_umwelt (warmth=0.8, metaphor_affinity=high)

[poet@root] » world.house.manifest
→ "Shelter, yes—but also the weight of doorways. Each threshold a little death."

[poet@root] » /as architect
→ Observer context: architect_umwelt (precision=0.9, structural_bias=high)

[architect@root] » world.house.manifest
→ { load_bearing_walls: 4, foundation: "concrete_slab", year: 1952 }
```

**No view from nowhere made visible.**

### 3.2 Time-Travel + Branch

Turn-indexed history with rewind/branch. The Flux law (Event-Driven Streaming) ensures perturbation respects state integrity.

```
[self.soul] » time.trace.witness
→ Turn 0: [GROUNDED] eigenvalue=(0.7, 0.6, 0.5, ...)
→ Turn 3: [DELIBERATING] tension with shadow detected
→ Turn 7: [SHADOW_DIALOGUE] integration in progress
→ Turn 12: [RESOLVED] stability restored

[self.soul] » time.branch.create [at=Turn3]
→ Branch "turn3_alternate" created. You are now on branch.

[self.soul@turn3_alternate] » concept.shadow.manifest [entropy=0.3]
→ "What if the shadow was not resistance but invitation?"
```

### 3.3 Skill Crystallization

Frequently composed paths become named skills (Generative Over Enumerative, AD-003).

```
[root] » /define-skill research_flow
  path_1: world.corpus.manifest
  path_2: concept.hypothesis.refine[entropy=0.1]
  path_3: self.memory.engram[minimal_output=true]
→ Skill "research_flow" registered. Usage: /research_flow <corpus_id>

[root] » /research_flow papers/smallville
→ Executing: world.corpus.manifest >> concept.hypothesis.refine >> self.memory.engram
→ Engram stored: "Smallville's memory stream enables emergence..."
```

### 3.4 LSP/IDE Projections

Autocomplete/hover from operad grammar across REPL, VS Code, marimo.

```yaml
# .kgents/lsp-config.yaml
projections:
  vscode:
    completions: true
    hover: true
    diagnostics: true
  marimo:
    cell_hints: true
    affordance_preview: true
```

**Blocked by**: LSP protocol implementation effort; marimo plugin API stability.

---

## Part IV: AUP (Universal Grammar)

The Agent Universal Protocol is how external systems talk to kgents. It's the REST/GraphQL/gRPC facade of AGENTESE.

### 4.1 Single Contract

AUP is the canonical projection of AGENTESE paths. All transport protocols are views of the same operad.

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**REST/SSE**: Shipped and operational.
**GraphQL/gRPC**: Blocked by demand validation; REST sufficient for current users.

### 4.2 Traceable by Default

Each call emits a span: `(trace_id, path, observer, entropy_budget, law_checks)`.

```json
{
  "trace_id": "abc123",
  "path": "world.town.manifest",
  "observer": "web_user_42",
  "entropy_budget": 0.05,
  "law_checks": ["identity", "associativity"],
  "duration_ms": 127,
  "model": "haiku",
  "tokens": { "in": 150, "out": 420 },
  "cost_usd": 0.00056
}
```

### 4.3 Garden Federation

Multiple gardens publish public holons. Cross-garden composition obeys operad laws.

```

**Blocked by**: User volume (federation complexity premature for single-tenant scale).

### 4.4 Multi-Town Synergies

> *"Towns are not islands. They are nodes in a civilizational graph."*

**The Core Insight**: When multiple Agent Towns coexist, emergent inter-town dynamics become possible. This is not just "federation"—it's **civilizational composition**.

#### 4.4.1 Synergy Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Example | Revenue Model |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------------|
| **Embassy** | Permanent citizen exchange between towns | Clara (Kent's Town) becomes ambassador to Alice's Town | Premium tier feature |
| **Trade Route** | Resource/credit flow between economies | Enterprise Town purchases "creativity credits" from Art Town | Settlement fees |
| **Pilgrimage** | Citizens temporarily visit other towns | Sage goes to Research Town for 3-day study | Cross-billing |
| **Summit** | Multi-town gatherings for collective decisions | Quarterly "Mayor's Council" across 5 towns | Event-based pricing |
| **Merger** | Towns combine (with consent) into larger polity | Two startup teams merge their Builder Workshops | Migration fee |
| **Schism** | Town splits into factions (emergent, not designed) | Creative differences spawn two distinct towns | Branch creation cost |

#### 4.4.2 Synergy Economics

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 4.4.3 Emergent Inter-Town Phenomena

What happens when towns interact over time:

| Phenomenon | Description | Monitoring | Response |
|------------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Dialect Drift** | Towns develop distinct AGENTESE dialects | Track vocabulary divergence | Periodically sync base ontology |
| **Specialization** | Towns naturally specialize (research, trade, art) | Measure capability distribution | Encourage via incentives |
| **Conflict** | Inter-town disputes over resources or norms | Detect tension escalation | Enable mediation mechanics |
| **Cultural Blend** | Ambassador citizens cross-pollinate cultures | Track eigenvector mixing | Celebrate hybrid identities |
| **Cascade Events** | One town's crisis spreads to connected towns | Monitor contagion graphs | Circuit breakers at federation layer |

#### 4.4.4 Research Directions

These are areas requiring further exploration:

1. **Operad Composition Across Towns**: How do town-local operads compose into a federation-level super-operad? Does associativity hold across town boundaries?

2. **Consent at Scale**: When a citizen from Town A visits Town B, whose consent rules apply? INHABIT across town boundaries requires careful consent protocol.

3. **Identity Continuity**: If Clara visits three towns, is she the same Clara? How does memory persistence work across town boundaries?

4. **Economic Equilibrium**: Do multi-town economies find stable equilibria, or do they naturally centralize/fragment?

5. **Emergence Monitoring**: Current EmergenceMonitor is single-town. How do we detect pathological patterns that only manifest at the inter-town level?

6. **Autopoietic Town Evolution**: Towns themselves may evolve—spawning new towns, merging, splitting. The system must support towns as autopoietic entities, not just citizens.

## Part V: Agent Town (Civilizational Engine)

### 5.0 The Default Town: Builder's Workshop

> *"Chefs in a kitchen. Cooks in a garden. Kids on a playground. But they're building software."*

The default Agent Town experience is not a passive simulation to observe—it's a **collaborative software workshop** where AI builder personas help you create.

**The Core Metaphors**:

| Metaphor | Meaning | In Practice |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Chefs in a Kitchen** | Expertise, mise en place, coordinated execution | Each builder has specialties; they prep components before the rush |
| **Cooks in a Garden** | Cultivation, patience, seasonal rhythms | Some work is slow-growing; builders tend long-running tasks |
| **Kids on a Playground** | Play, exploration, joyful experimentation | Creativity emerges from safe play; builders try wild ideas |

**The Five Core Builders** (v1):

| Builder | Archetype | Specialty | Personality |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Sage** | The Architect | System design, patterns, tradeoffs | Thoughtful, asks "but why?" |
| **Spark** | The Experimenter | Prototypes, spikes, wild ideas | Playful, "what if we tried..." |
| **Steady** | The Craftsperson | Clean code, tests, documentation | Reliable, "let me refine this" |
| **Scout** | The Researcher | Prior art, libraries, alternatives | Curious, "I found something..." |
| **Sync** | The Coordinator | Dependencies, blockers, integration | Organized, "here's the plan" |

**The Workshop Flow**:

**Why This Works**:

1. **Productive from Day 1**: Users get help building, not just watching
2. **Natural Monetization**: Pay for more builders, deeper expertise, faster work
3. **Joy-Inducing**: The builders have personality; collaboration is fun
4. **AGENTESE Native**: Each builder maps to paths (`world.builder.sage.manifest`)
5. **Scales to Enterprise**: Teams can have private workshops with custom builders

**The Workshop as Default**:

When you run `kg town` without arguments, you get the Builder's Workshop—not a generic village simulation.

```bash
$ kg town
→ Welcome to the Builder's Workshop!
→ Five builders are ready to help you create.

[Sage] "What are we building today?"
[Scout] *already researching your recent git commits*
[Spark] "I have three ideas already!"

### 5.1 LOD Pyramid (Value-Priced, 37.5% Margin Cap)

> *"Cheap products have high margins. Premium products have capped margins. We never charge more than the experience is worth."*

| LOD | Name | Content | Model | Our Cost | User Price | Margin | Philosophy |
|-----|------|---------|-------|----------|------------|--------|------------|
| 0 | Silhouette | Name, location, emoji | Cache | ~$0 | FREE | — | Gift. Loss leader. |
| 1 | Posture | Action, mood, facing | Cache | ~$0 | FREE | — | Gift. Loss leader. |
| 2 | Dialogue | Recent speech, greetings | Haiku | $0.002 | $0.003 | 33% | Accessible depth |
| 3 | Memory | Active memories, goals | Haiku+ctx | $0.008 | $0.010 | 20% | Value-conscious |
| 4 | Psyche | Eigenvectors, tensions | Sonnet | $0.05 | $0.065 | 23% | Premium start |
| 5 | Abyss | *The irreducible mystery* | Opus | $0.22 | $0.30 | **27%** | Value-priced depth |

**Key Insight**: LOD 5 (Abyss) could command 60%+ margins—users would pay. But we cap at 37.5% because the experience should be accessible. Premium doesn't mean extractive.

**Free Tier Generosity**:
- LOD 0-1: Unlimited (cached, zero marginal cost)
- LOD 2-3: 50 free per day (premium experience, not hobbled)
- LOD 4-5: 5 free per week (taste of depth, creates desire)

**The Abyss Guarantee**: LOD5 is not "more detail." It's a qualitative shift—poetic, irreducible, hauntingly incomplete. Users pay for mystery, not mere data.

### 5.2 INHABIT with Rights

```python
class INHABITSession:
    """User merges with citizen. Citizen retains agency."""

    async def suggest_action(self, action: str) -> CitizenResponse:
        """User suggests; citizen may comply, modify, or refuse."""

        # Evaluate against eigenvectors
        alignment = self.citizen.eigenvector_alignment(action)

        if alignment > 0.7:
            return CitizenResponse(type="comply", action=action)
        elif alignment > 0.4:
            modified = await self.citizen.modify_action(action)
            return CitizenResponse(type="modify", action=modified)
        else:
            refusal = await self.citizen.explain_refusal(action)
            return CitizenResponse(type="refuse", explanation=refusal)

    async def force_action(self, action: str) -> CitizenResponse:
        """Force compliance. Costly. Logged. Creates consent debt."""
        if not self.consent_ledger.can_force(action):
            raise AgencyViolationError("Forcing would harm citizen integrity")

        self.consent_ledger.add_debt(0.15)
        self.emit_span("consent_forced", action=action)
        return CitizenResponse(type="forced_comply", action=action, debt_added=0.15)
```

### 5.3 Mystery/Branch Engine

Two flagship scenarios at launch. More as premium SKUs (curated, not sprawling).

| Scenario | Description | Branches | Price |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------|
| **The Vanishing** | Clara disappears. Who did it? | 4 endings | $9.99 |
| **The Festival** | Plan Valentine's Day. Drama ensues. | 6 routes | $4.99 |

**Branch Economics**: Each branch costs 100 credits to create. This prevents unpriced state bloat while enabling exploration.

### 5.4 Affordable Generative Agents

Per research (Park et al. 2024), learned policies can replace 80-95% of common LLM calls. Implementation path:

| Phase | LLM Usage | Policy Coverage | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| MVP | 100% LLM | 0% | **Current** |
| Phase 2 | 70% LLM | 30% policy | Blocked by: training data volume |
| Phase 3 | 30% LLM | 70% policy | Blocked by: policy model research |
| Mature | 5% LLM | 95% policy | Blocked by: scale + validation |

Policies handle: greetings, routine movements, weather comments, time-of-day behaviors.
LLM handles: novel situations, deep dialogue, relationship changes, mystery progression.

### 5.5 Emergence Monitor (MAEBE-inspired)

Watch for pathological emergence. Surface alerts, don't suppress.

```python
@dataclass
class EmergenceMetrics:
    """Real-time monitoring for multi-agent dynamics."""

    coalition_drift: float      # Are groups becoming too insular?
    eigenvector_collapse: float # Are personalities converging?
    synchrony_index: float      # Is the town too "in sync"?
    tension_variance: float     # Is conflict healthy or pathological?

    def health_check(self) -> EmergenceHealth:
        if self.eigenvector_collapse > 0.8:
            return EmergenceHealth.WARN_HOMOGENEITY
        if self.tension_variance < 0.1:
            return EmergenceHealth.WARN_STAGNATION
        if self.synchrony_index > 0.9:
            return EmergenceHealth.WARN_GROUPTHINK
        return EmergenceHealth.HEALTHY
```

## Part VI: Possible Paths (Scenarios)

> *"We build toward multiple possibilities simultaneously."*

### Scenario A: Agent Town Becomes the Product

In this path, Agent Town is the primary revenue driver. kgents is known as "the Agent Town company."

**Milestones**:
- 10K MAU, $100K ARR
- Mobile app (observe your town on the train)
- Celebrity/IP partnerships (official Westworld town?)
- Corporate training scenarios (crisis simulation)
- Educational market (history class as Agent Town)

**Blockers**: Mobile requires PMF validation first; IP partnerships require legal/bizdev resources.

### Scenario B: AGENTESE Becomes the Standard

In this path, AGENTESE gains adoption beyond kgents. We become "the HTTP of agent communication."

**Milestones**:
- Open-source AGENTESE spec published
- 3+ external implementations (LangGraph adapter, CrewAI bridge)
- Conference talks, academic citations
- AGENTESE Working Group (multi-org governance)
- Enterprise adoption (AGENTESE as compliance layer)

**Blockers**: Spec publication requires documentation effort; external implementations require evangelism.

### Scenario C: The Categorical Foundation Attracts Researchers

In this path, the mathematical rigor (operads, sheaves, polynomials) attracts academic/enterprise R&D partnerships.

**Milestones**:
- 2-3 academic collaborations
- Research grants for "safe emergence"
- Papers published (kgents as case study)
- Enterprise R&D contracts
- Formal verification of operad laws

**Blockers**: Academic pace is slow; enterprise sales cycles are long; papers don't convert to revenue.

### Scenario D: The Hybrid Path (Most Likely)

All three paths proceed in parallel, with resource allocation adjusting based on traction.

```
         Agent Town Revenue

             ╱ │ ╲

## Part VII: What To Build Now

> *"Delightful, understandable, and value-generating (profitable)."*

### 7.1 The Immediate Stack

| Component | Why Now | Effort | Revenue Impact | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|--------|
| **INHABIT CLI** | Core differentiator; testable without web | Medium | Enables demos | **SHIPPED** |
| **Web MVP** | Public demo → word of mouth | High | Direct revenue | In progress |
| **Stripe Integration** | Can't make money without payment | Medium | Direct revenue | **SHIPPED** |
| **LOD Metering** | Track costs before they surprise us | Low | Cost control | **SHIPPED** |
| **Pre-computed HotData** | Fast demos, cheap tests | Low | DevEx + costs | **SHIPPED** |

### 7.2 Sprint Goals

**Goal 1: First Paying Customer**
- Resident tier ($9.99/mo)
- LOD 0-2 unlimited, 100 LOD 3/month
- Personal town creation
- *Success metric*: 10 paying users

**Goal 2: Public Demo**
- Web UI showing live Agent Town
- Observer mode (free)
- Zoom-to-pay (LOD 3+ requires credits)
- *Success metric*: 500 unique visitors

**Goal 3: INHABIT Mode Complete**
- CLI: `kg town inhabit alice` — **SHIPPED**
- Consent/resistance mechanic — **SHIPPED**
- Session timeout + graceful exit — **SHIPPED**
- *Success metric*: 20 INHABIT sessions recorded

### 7.3 What NOT To Build Yet

| Temptation | Why Wait | Blocker |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Mobile app | Web first; mobile when PMF proven | PMF validation |
| Federation | Single-tenant until 1K users | User volume |
| VR/AR | Projection protocol ready when we are | Hardware adoption |
| 25+ citizens | Optimize 5 citizens before scaling | Performance validation |
| Policy models | LLM-only until costs force optimization | Training data |
| GraphQL/gRPC | REST/SSE sufficient for MVP | Demand signals |

## Part VIII: The Joy-Inducing Imperative

Throughout all paths, one principle remains paramount:

> *"If it's not delightful, we've failed."*

### 8.1 Delight Metrics

Every feature must pass the Joy Test:

1. **Would I want to demo this?** If showing it to a friend feels embarrassing, don't ship.
2. **Does it surprise?** Predictable is boring. Emergence should delight.
3. **Does it have personality?** ASCII art, playful copy, citizens with humor.
4. **Is it fast?** Delight dies in latency. Haiku is fast. Use it.

### 8.2 The Kent Test (Mirror Test)

> *"Does K-gent feel like Kent on his best day?"*

This isn't vanity—it's quality control. The system embodies a coherent worldview. If any part feels off, the whole suffers.

Questions to ask:
- Would Kent use this feature?
- Does this feel considered, or rushed?
- Is there personality here, or is it generic?
- Would Kent show this to someone he respects?

---

## Part IX: Risks & Guardrails

### 9.1 Cost Creep
**Risk**: LOD4/5 pricing doesn't clear costs.
**Guardrail**: Reprice quarterly; shrink outputs before raising prices; invest in policies.

### 9.2 Ethical Drift
**Risk**: Pay-to-override without consent debt becomes dark pattern.
**Guardrail**: Consent ledger mandatory; cooldowns enforced; forcing logged and limited.

### 9.3 Spec Rot
**Risk**: Implementation diverges from spec.
**Guardrail**: Generative spec → impl; tests derived from operad laws; weekly spec audits.

### 9.4 Feature Sprawl
**Risk**: >2 scenario packs at launch dilutes taste.
**Guardrail**: Curated (Principle #2) is hard. Say no more than yes.

### 9.5 Observability Debt
**Risk**: Costs and latencies become fiction without spans.
**Guardrail**: No feature merges without observability hooks. Tracing is table-stakes.

### 9.6 Emergence Pathology
**Risk**: Multi-agent dynamics produce unexpected harmful patterns.
**Guardrail**: EmergenceMonitor mandatory; automatic alerts; human review on pathology flags.

## Part X: External Signals (Grounding)

### Pricing Benchmarks (Hard Data)
- Claude public pricing (Anthropic docs):
  - Haiku: $0.25/$1.25 per M (in/out)
  - Sonnet: $3/$15 per M
  - Opus: $15/$75 per M
- These govern our margins. Update quarterly.

## Litmus (Mirror Test)

Before shipping any feature, ask:

1. **Composability**: Does this increase composability?
2. **Joy**: Does this increase joy?
3. **Margin-Safe**: Does this stay margin-safe?
4. **Ethical**: Does this respect citizen/user agency?
5. **Generative**: Can we regenerate the impl from spec?
6. **Transparent**: Can we observe it in traces?
7. **Mirror**: Would Kent look at this and say "this feels like me on my best day"?

**If "no" to any, do not ship.**

## Epilogue: The Garden We're Growing

> *"We are not building agents. We are growing gardens where agents can flourish."*

The many-agent landscape is unfolding whether we build for it or not. Our job is not to predict exactly what that landscape looks like—it's to build the substrate that makes good outcomes more likely.

That substrate is:
- **AGENTESE**: A grammar for agent-world interaction that respects observers
- **AUP**: A protocol that makes agents interoperable
- **Agent Town**: A proof that emergence can be safe, delightful, and profitable
- **The Seven Principles**: Guardrails that keep us tasteful, ethical, and joyful

Emergence will surprise us. That's the point. Our job is to be ready.

*"A language, not a product. A garden, not a stack. The simulation isn't a game. It's a seance. We are not building. We are summoning."*
