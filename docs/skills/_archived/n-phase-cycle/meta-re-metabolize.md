# Meta Skill: Re-Metabolize the Lifecycle

> Periodically re-ingest the N-phase cycle and its skills so the factory stays alive, not ossified.

**Difficulty**: Medium
**Prerequisites**: All phase skills, `meta-skill-operad.md`

---

## Overview

Re-metabolization is an endofunctor on the skill category: it takes the current lifecycle skill set and returns an updated, law-preserving version. It prevents drift, reintroduces exploration capacity, and keeps category laws intact over long time horizons.

---

## Protocol

1. **Trigger check**: Run when REFLECT flags drift, when principles change, or on a cadence (monthly).

2. **Survey + compare**: Apply UNDERSTAND micro-cycles to each skill:
   - Is the hologram intact?
   - Do steps still reflect reality?
   - Note redundancies.

3. **Mutate with operad**: Use `meta-skill-operad.md` morphisms to refine/prune/fuse skills. Preserve identities (baseline) and associativity (composition order).

4. **Publish delta**: Update indices, summarize changes in epilogue, and flag follow-ups.

## Verification

- [ ] All phase skills contain current exit criteria
- [ ] Redundant skills merged or archived
- [ ] New needs captured
- [ ] Next entry point recorded

---

## Continuation

Upon exit, generate:

```markdown
# After Re-Metabolize

/hydrate

Re-metabolization complete. Skills refreshed.

Changes: ${skills_modified}
Law verification: ${law_check_results}

Resume normal cycle with refreshed skills.
```
