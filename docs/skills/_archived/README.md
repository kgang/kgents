> Archived: 2025-12-18 | Phase 6 Annihilation

These skills were archived as part of the autopoietic architecture consolidation.

## Archive Policy

- **30-day retention**: Files may be permanently deleted after 30 days
- **Restoration**: Move back to parent directory if needed
- **Reference only**: Do not add new content to archived files

## Why Archived?

The autopoietic-architecture.md defines 13 minimal skills necessary and sufficient
for building any kgents component. Additional skills were kept for core infrastructure
and active protocol documentation. Everything else was archived to reduce cognitive
load and maintenance burden.
