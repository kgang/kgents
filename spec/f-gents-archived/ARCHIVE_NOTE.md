# F-gent Archive: Forge Agents (Deprecated)

**Archived**: 2025-12-16
**Reason**: F-gent letter reassigned to **Flow** agents

## What Happened

The original F-gent "Forge" concept has been superseded by **Flow** agents.

### Why the Change

1. **Forge was underutilized** - No active implementation existed
2. **Overlapping responsibilities**:
   - Intent parsing → J-gent (JIT compilation)
   - Contract synthesis → C-gent (composition)
   - Artifact versioning → L-gent (librarian)
   - Drift detection → E-gent (evolution)
3. **Flux needed a home** - The foundational streaming infrastructure was orphaned
4. **Modern AI workflows** need:
   - Chat paradigms (streaming conversation)
   - Tree of thought research
   - Multi-agent collaboration (blackboard patterns)

### Where Forge Concepts Went

| Forge Concept | New Home | Rationale |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| Intent analysis | J-gent | JIT compilation from natural language |
| Contract synthesis | C-gent | Composition and type alignment |
| Artifact versioning | L-gent | Library cataloging and lineage |
| Drift detection | E-gent | Evolution and adaptation |
| ALO format | Deprecated | Too complex; simpler patterns suffice |
