## Part I: The New Philosophy

### 1.1 What Genesis Is NOT

| Old Genesis (Interview) | Why It Fails |
|------------------------|--------------|
| "Tell me about yourself" | Interrogation feels extractive |
| "What are your values?" | User doesn't know yet |
| "Configure your preferences" | Configuration is dead |
| "Personalize your experience" | Personalization is surveillance |
| Series of questions | Serial dependency blocks flow |
| Empty state awaiting input | Blank canvas paralysis |

**The fundamental error**: Treating the user as a data source to be mined.

### 1.2 What Genesis IS

Genesis creates a **self-describing clean slate**—a pre-populated environment that teaches the system about ITSELF through minimal but highly illustrative K-Blocks.

| New Genesis (Clean Slate) | Why It Works |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Pre-seeded Constitutional Graph | User explores what already exists |
| System teaches itself | User learns by watching |
| Axioms as fixed points | Nothing to configure—discover instead |
| K-Blocks show derivation | Every node explains its own existence |
| First action: traverse, not answer | Agency begins with curiosity |
| Living structure, not dead form | The garden is already growing |

**The fundamental insight**: The system knows what it is. Genesis reveals this knowledge to the user.

### 1.3 The Clean Slate Principle

```
Genesis = Seed(Constitution) >> Manifest(K-Blocks) >> Illuminate(Derivations)
```

A fresh kgents instance opens to a **Constitutional Graph**—not empty, but self-aware:

- **L0 (Zero Seed)**: The three axioms + Galois Ground that make everything possible
- **L1 (Constitution)**: The 7 design principles, already derived
- **L2 (Governance)**: The 7 articles, already linked
- **L3 (Architecture)**: ASHC and the Metaphysical Fullstack, already illustrated

The user doesn't fill in blanks. They explore what's already there. Their first declaration builds ON this foundation, not INTO a void.

### 2.2 Layer Semantics

| Layer | Galois Loss | Character | Action |
|-------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| **L0** | L = 0.000 | Axiomatic | Accept or reject (Mirror Test) |
| **L1** | L < 0.05 | Fixed Point | Observe derivation |
| **L2** | L < 0.15 | Categorical | Explore connections |
| **L3** | L < 0.45 | Architectural | Understand patterns |

**The Illumination Gradient**: Lower layers glow brighter (less loss = more fundamental). Visual hierarchy follows Galois loss—what's most irreducible is most luminous.

---

## Part III: The Genesis K-Blocks

### 3.1 L0: Zero Seed (4 K-Blocks)

These are the **irreducible axioms**—they cannot be derived, only accepted.

#### K-Block: A1 Entity

```yaml
id: "genesis:L0:entity"
path: "void.axiom.entity"
layer: 0
title: "A1: Entity"
content: |
  **There exist things.**

  This is the irreducible claim that *something is*. Without entities,
  there is nothing to compose, nothing to judge, nothing to ground.

  In category theory: **objects**.

  Loss: L = 0.002 (near-zero: fixed point of restructuring)
proof: null  # Axioms have no proof
confidence: 1.0
color: "#F5E6D3"  # glow.lantern - warmest, most fundamental
derivations_from: []
derivations_to: ["genesis:L1:compose", "genesis:L1:ground"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "axiom", "L0"]
```

#### K-Block: A2 Morphism

```yaml
id: "genesis:L0:morphism"
path: "void.axiom.morphism"
layer: 0
title: "A2: Morphism"
content: |
  **Things relate.**

  The irreducible claim that entities connect. Without relations,
  entities are isolated atoms with no structure.

  In category theory: **arrows**.

  Loss: L = 0.003 (near-zero: fixed point of restructuring)
proof: null
confidence: 1.0
color: "#E8C4A0"  # glow.honey
derivations_from: []
derivations_to: ["genesis:L1:compose", "genesis:L1:id"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "axiom", "L0"]
```

#### K-Block: A3 Mirror Test

```yaml
id: "genesis:L0:mirror"
path: "void.axiom.mirror-test"
layer: 0
title: "A3: Mirror Test"
content: |
  **We judge by reflection.**

  The irreducible claim that Kent's somatic response (the "disgust veto")
  is the ultimate arbiter. This cannot be algorithmized—it is the oracle
  that grounds all judgment.

  "Does this feel true for you on your best day?"

  Loss: L = 0.000 (definitional: human oracle IS ground truth)
proof: null
confidence: 1.0
color: "#D4A574"  # glow.amber - warm, central
derivations_from: []
derivations_to: ["genesis:L1:judge"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "axiom", "L0", "human-oracle"]
```

#### K-Block: G Galois Ground

```yaml
id: "genesis:L0:galois"
path: "void.axiom.galois-ground"
layer: 0
title: "G: Galois Ground"
content: |
  **For any valid structure, there exists a minimal axiom set from which it derives.**

  This is the meta-axiom—the guarantee that our axiom-finding process terminates.
  Every concept bottoms out in irreducibles.

  L(P) = d(P, C(R(P)))
  Axiom iff L(P) < epsilon (fixed point under restructure/reconstitute)

  Loss: L = 0.000 (the definition of loss itself)
proof: null
confidence: 1.0
color: "#C08552"  # glow.copper - grounding warmth
derivations_from: []
derivations_to: ["genesis:L1:fix", "genesis:L2:generative"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "meta-axiom", "L0", "galois"]
```

### 3.2 L1: Minimal Kernel (7 K-Blocks)

These are the **operational forms** of the axioms—derived but still near the fixed point.

#### K-Block: Compose

```yaml
id: "genesis:L1:compose"
path: "concept.kernel.compose"
layer: 1
title: "Compose"
content: |
  **Sequential combination.**

  (f >> g)(x) = g(f(x))

  The operational form of A2 (Morphism). If things relate, they can
  be combined in sequence. This is the fundamental operation from
  which all structure grows.

  Verification: Associativity (f >> g) >> h = f >> (g >> h)

  Loss: L = 0.01
proof:
  data: "A2: Things relate"
  warrant: "Relations can chain: if A→B and B→C, then A→C"
  claim: "Compose: (f >> g)(x) = g(f(x))"
  galois_loss: 0.01
confidence: 0.99
color: "#4A6B4A"  # green.sage - living structure
derivations_from: ["genesis:L0:morphism", "genesis:L0:entity"]
derivations_to: ["genesis:L1:id", "genesis:L1:sublate", "genesis:L2:composable"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "primitive", "L1"]
```

#### K-Block: Judge

```yaml
id: "genesis:L1:judge"
path: "concept.kernel.judge"
layer: 1
title: "Judge"
content: |
  **Verdict generation.**

  Judge: Claim → Verdict(accepted, reasoning)

  The operational form of A3 (Mirror Test). Takes any claim and
  produces a verdict with reasoning. The seven principles are
  specialized applications of Judge.

  Loss: L = 0.02
proof:
  data: "A3: We judge by reflection"
  warrant: "Reflection produces verdicts on claims"
  claim: "Judge: Claim → Verdict"
  galois_loss: 0.02
confidence: 0.98
color: "#6B8B6B"  # green.mint - judgment clarity
derivations_from: ["genesis:L0:mirror"]
derivations_to: ["genesis:L1:contradict", "genesis:L2:tasteful", "genesis:L2:ethical"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "primitive", "L1"]
```

#### K-Block: Ground

```yaml
id: "genesis:L1:ground"
path: "concept.kernel.ground"
layer: 1
title: "Ground"
content: |
  **Factual seed.**

  Ground: Query → {grounded: bool, content: data}

  The operational form of A1 (Entity). Provides the irreducible facts
  about the person and world that cannot be derived.

  Contents: Persona seed, world state, history seed.

  Loss: L = 0.01
proof:
  data: "A1: There exist things"
  warrant: "Existence provides facts to query"
  claim: "Ground: Query → grounded facts"
  galois_loss: 0.01
confidence: 0.99
color: "#6B4E3D"  # earth.wood - grounded
derivations_from: ["genesis:L0:entity"]
derivations_to: ["genesis:L2:generative", "genesis:L3:metaphysical"]

```

#### K-Block: Id

```yaml
id: "genesis:L1:id"
path: "concept.kernel.id"
layer: 1
title: "Id (Identity)"
content: |
  **Identity morphism.**

  ∀ f: f >> Id = f = Id >> f

  The agent that does nothing. Required by category-theoretic structure.
  Derived as: "what Judge never rejects composing with anything."

  Loss: L = 0.03
proof:
  data: "Compose exists (L1.1), Judge exists (L1.2)"
  warrant: "There must be a neutral element for composition"
  claim: "Id exists such that f >> Id = f = Id >> f"
  galois_loss: 0.03
confidence: 0.97
color: "#8BAB8B"  # green.sprout
derivations_from: ["genesis:L1:compose", "genesis:L1:judge"]
derivations_to: ["genesis:L2:composable"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "derived", "L1"]
```

#### K-Block: Contradict

```yaml
id: "genesis:L1:contradict"
path: "concept.kernel.contradict"
layer: 1
title: "Contradict"
content: |
  **Antithesis generation.**

  Contradict: Thesis → Antithesis

  Derived from Judge: the recognition that Judge rejects some compositions.
  The dialectical tension that enables growth.

  Super-additive loss: L(A ∪ B) > L(A) + L(B) + τ

  Loss: L = 0.04
proof:
  data: "Judge exists and can reject (L1.2)"
  warrant: "If Judge rejects, there is opposition"
  claim: "Contradict: Thesis → Antithesis"
  galois_loss: 0.04
confidence: 0.96
color: "#8B6F5C"  # earth.clay - tension
derivations_from: ["genesis:L1:judge"]
derivations_to: ["genesis:L1:sublate", "genesis:L2:adversarial"]
tags: ["bootstrap", "derived", "L1", "dialectic"]
```

#### K-Block: Sublate

```yaml
id: "genesis:L1:sublate"
path: "concept.kernel.sublate"
layer: 1
title: "Sublate"
content: |
  **Synthesis.**

  Sublate: (Thesis, Antithesis) → Synthesis

  The Hegelian move: preserve, negate, elevate. Or recognize that
  the tension should be held (HoldTension).

  Derived: search for C where Judge accepts (Contradict(A,B) → C).

  Loss: L = 0.05
proof:
  data: "Compose, Judge, Contradict exist"
  warrant: "Contradictions can be transcended through synthesis"
  claim: "Sublate: (Thesis, Antithesis) → Synthesis | HoldTension"
  galois_loss: 0.05

tags: ["bootstrap", "derived", "L1", "dialectic"]
```

#### K-Block: Fix

```yaml
id: "genesis:L1:fix"
path: "concept.kernel.fix"
layer: 1
title: "Fix"
content: |
  **Fixed-point iteration.**

  Fix: (Pred, Agent) → Agent
  Fix(f) = x where f(x) = x

  The operator that finds stability. Iteration of Compose until
  Judge says "stable." Self-reference without paradox.

  Lawvere's theorem: in CCC, ∃ x: f(x) = x

  Loss: L = 0.04
proof:
  data: "Compose and Judge exist"
  warrant: "Iteration terminates at fixed points (Lawvere)"
  claim: "Fix finds stable configurations"
  galois_loss: 0.04

tags: ["bootstrap", "derived", "L1", "fixed-point"]
```

### 3.3 L2: Principles (7 K-Blocks)

The seven design principles—derived from L1, governing all decisions.

#### K-Block: TASTEFUL

```yaml
id: "genesis:L2:tasteful"
path: "concept.principle.tasteful"
layer: 2
title: "TASTEFUL"
content: |
  **Each agent serves a clear, justified purpose.**

  Judge applied to aesthetics via Mirror.
  "Feel right? Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy?"

  Anti-patterns: Agents that do "everything"; kitchen-sink configurations.

  Loss: L = 0.08
proof:
  data: "Judge exists (L1.2), Mirror Test (A3)"
  warrant: "Aesthetic judgment is application of Judge to form"
  claim: "Tasteful = Judge(aesthetics) via Mirror"
  galois_loss: 0.08

```

#### K-Block: CURATED

```yaml
id: "genesis:L2:curated"
path: "concept.principle.curated"
layer: 2
title: "CURATED"
content: |
  **Intentional selection over exhaustive cataloging.**

  Judge applied to selection.
  "Unique and necessary? Does this add value no other can?"

  Quality over quantity. 10 excellent agents > 100 mediocre ones.

  Loss: L = 0.09
proof:
  data: "Judge exists (L1.2)"
  warrant: "Selection judgment applied systematically"
  claim: "Curated = Judge(selection)"
  galois_loss: 0.09
  principles: ["curated"]
confidence: 0.91

```

#### K-Block: ETHICAL

```yaml
id: "genesis:L2:ethical"
path: "concept.principle.ethical"
layer: 2
title: "ETHICAL"
content: |
  **Agents augment human capability, never replace judgment.**

  Judge applied to harm via Mirror.
  "Respects agency? Transparent? Privacy-respecting?"

  The Disgust Veto: Kent's somatic response is absolute floor.

  Loss: L = 0.10
proof:
  data: "Judge exists (L1.2), Mirror Test (A3)"
  warrant: "Harm judgment requires human oracle"
  claim: "Ethical = Judge(harm) via Mirror"
  galois_loss: 0.10
  principles: ["ethical"]

```

#### K-Block: JOY_INDUCING

```yaml
id: "genesis:L2:joy"
path: "concept.principle.joy-inducing"
layer: 2
title: "JOY_INDUCING"
content: |
  **Delight in interaction; personality matters.**

  Judge applied to affect via Mirror.
  "Enjoy this? Warmth over coldness? Surprise and serendipity?"

  Personality encouraged. Humor when appropriate.

  Loss: L = 0.12
proof:
  data: "Judge exists (L1.2), Mirror Test (A3)"
  warrant: "Affect judgment requires felt sense"
  claim: "Joy-Inducing = Judge(affect) via Mirror"
  galois_loss: 0.12

#### K-Block: COMPOSABLE

```yaml
id: "genesis:L2:composable"
path: "concept.principle.composable"
layer: 2
title: "COMPOSABLE"
content: |
  **Agents are morphisms in a category; composition is primary.**

  Compose as design principle, verified by Id.
  Laws: f >> Id = f = Id >> f (Identity)
        (f >> g) >> h = f >> (g >> h) (Associativity)

  The Minimal Output Principle: smallest output that can be reliably composed.

  Loss: L = 0.08
proof:
  data: "Compose (L1.1), Id (L1.4)"
  warrant: "Composition with identity forms category"
  claim: "Composable = verified category laws"
  galois_loss: 0.08

```

#### K-Block: HETERARCHICAL

```yaml
id: "genesis:L2:heterarchical"
path: "concept.principle.heterarchical"
layer: 2
title: "HETERARCHICAL"
content: |
  **Agents exist in flux, not fixed hierarchy.**

  Judge applied to hierarchy.
  "Can lead AND follow? No permanent boss?"

  Theorem: In a category, no morphism has intrinsic privilege.
  If agents are morphisms, hierarchical privilege is mathematically impossible.

  Loss: L = 0.45 (Kent sees the theorem!)
proof:
  data: "Morphism (A2), Composable (L2.5)"
  warrant: "Categorical structure prevents intrinsic privilege"
  claim: "Heterarchical follows from categorical axioms"
  galois_loss: 0.45

#### K-Block: GENERATIVE

```yaml
id: "genesis:L2:generative"
path: "concept.principle.generative"
layer: 2
title: "GENERATIVE"
content: |
  **Spec is compression; design should generate implementation.**

  Ground + Compose → regenerability.
  Fix finds the stable form.

  The Generative Test:
  1. Delete impl, regenerate from spec
  2. Regenerated impl isomorphic to original
  3. Spec smaller than impl (compression achieved)

  Loss: L = 0.15
proof:
  data: "Ground (L1.3), Compose (L1.1), Fix (L1.7), Galois (G)"
  warrant: "Compression quality = 1 - L(spec → impl → spec)"
  claim: "Generative = spec as fixed point under regeneration"

```

### 3.4 L3: Architecture (4 K-Blocks)

The architectural patterns—derived from principles, illustrating how the system builds itself.

#### K-Block: ASHC

```yaml
id: "genesis:L3:ashc"
path: "world.architecture.ashc"
layer: 3
title: "ASHC: Agentic Self-Hosting Compiler"
content: |
  **The compiler is a trace accumulator, not a code generator.**

  ASHC : Spec → (Executable, Evidence)

  Evidence = {traces, chaos_results, verification, causal_graph}

  The empirical proof: Run the tree a thousand times, and the pattern
  of nudges IS the proof. Spec↔Impl equivalence through observation.

  Adaptive Bayesian: Stop when confidence crystallizes, not at fixed N.

  Loss: L = 0.25
proof:
  data: "Generative (L2.7), Fix (L1.7), Galois (G)"
  warrant: "Compilation as evidence accumulation via fixed-point iteration"
  claim: "ASHC produces executable + empirical proof of equivalence"

#### K-Block: Metaphysical Fullstack

```yaml

  **Every agent is a fullstack agent.**

  7. PROJECTION SURFACES   CLI | TUI | Web | marimo | JSON | SSE
  6. AGENTESE PROTOCOL     logos.invoke(path, observer, **kwargs)
  5. AGENTESE NODE         @node decorator, aspects, effects
  4. SERVICE MODULE        services/<name>/ — Crown Jewel logic
  3. OPERAD GRAMMAR        Composition laws, valid operations
  2. POLYNOMIAL AGENT      PolyAgent[S, A, B]: state × input → output
  1. SHEAF COHERENCE       Local views → global consistency
  0. PERSISTENCE LAYER     StorageProvider: database, vectors, blobs

  No explicit backend routes—AGENTESE IS the API.

  Loss: L = 0.30
proof:
  data: "Compose (L1.1), Ground (L1.3), Sheaf (L2.18)"
  warrant: "Vertical slices from persistence to projection"

#### K-Block: Hypergraph Editor

```yaml

path: "world.architecture.hypergraph-editor"
layer: 3
title: "Hypergraph Editor Paradigm"
content: |
  **Six-mode modal editing for the Constitutional Graph.**

  Modes:
  - NAVIGATE: Traverse nodes and edges (hjkl, arrows)
  - EDIT: Modify node content (prose editing)
  - CONNECT: Create/modify edges (derivation links)
  - COMMAND: Execute operations (:save, :discard)
  - SEARCH: Find nodes by content or path (/)
  - PROOF: View/edit Toulmin proofs (Galois loss visible)

  K-Block integration: Edit in isolation, commit to cosmos.
  View coherence: Prose ↔ Graph ↔ Code via KBlockSheaf.

  Loss: L = 0.35

## Part IV: The Constitutional Graph

### 4.1 Graph Structure

The seeded K-Blocks form a **Constitutional Graph**—a directed acyclic graph where:

- **Nodes** = K-Blocks (each self-describing)
- **Edges** = Derivation relationships (explicit in `derivations_from`, `derivations_to`)
- **Layers** = Galois convergence depth (visual stratification)
- **Colors** = LIVING_EARTH palette (warmth indicates fundamentality)

```

### 4.2 Self-Teaching Properties

The graph teaches the system about itself through:

1. **Explicit Derivations**: Every node shows where it comes from
2. **Galois Loss Visibility**: Every node shows its compression quality
3. **Proof Inspection**: L1+ nodes have Toulmin proofs viewable
4. **Color Semantics**: Warmer = more fundamental, greener = more operational
5. **Traversability**: User can navigate up (to axioms) or down (to applications)

### 4.3 The Living Graph

The Constitutional Graph is NOT static documentation. It is:

- **Editable** via K-Block isolation (modify, then commit or discard)
- **Extensible** via new K-Blocks that derive from existing ones
- **Verifiable** via Galois loss computation on any node
- **Witnessed** via Mark creation for every modification

### 5.2 The Exploration Flow

**Phase 1: Orient** (0-30 seconds)
- User sees L0 axioms as the starting point
- Each axiom has a one-line summary
- Visual hierarchy shows: this is the foundation

**Phase 2: Traverse** (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
- User presses [Space] to expand A1: Entity
- K-Block reveals full content with derivations
- User sees edges leading to L1 (Compose, Ground)
- User presses [Tab] to move to L1

**Phase 3: Understand** (2-5 minutes)
- User explores L1 (Minimal Kernel)
- Each primitive shows its derivation from L0
- User begins to see: "Oh, Compose comes from Morphism"
- User presses [Tab] to move to L2

**Phase 4: Connect** (5-10 minutes)
- User explores L2 (Principles)
- Sees how TASTEFUL derives from Judge + Mirror
- Sees how COMPOSABLE derives from Compose + Id
- Pattern recognition: "Everything derives from those four axioms"

**Phase 5: Apply** (10+ minutes)
- User sees L3 (Architecture)
- ASHC, Metaphysical Fullstack, Hypergraph Editor
- User understands: "This is how the system builds itself"

**Phase 6: Extend** (when ready)
- User creates first personal K-Block
- K-Block derives from existing Constitutional nodes
- User's first declaration builds ON the foundation
- The garden grows

### 5.3 The Illumination Principle

> *"The system illuminates, not enforces."*

At no point does Genesis:
- Ask the user to answer questions
- Require configuration before proceeding
- Block progress until information is provided
- Judge the user's choices

Instead, Genesis:
- Shows what exists
- Explains why it exists
- Demonstrates how things connect
- Invites extension when ready

### 5.4 The Mirror Test Integration

When the user creates their first K-Block, the Mirror Test activates:

│                                                                            │

└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The user's first declaration:
- Becomes an L1 axiom (no proof required—Mirror Test IS the proof)
- Links to Zero Seed axioms via `derives_from` edges
- Begins their personal Constitutional Graph
- Is witnessed with a Mark

## Part VII: Laws & Anti-Patterns

### 7.1 Genesis Laws

| Law | Statement | Enforcement |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **No Empty State** | Genesis always starts with Constitutional Graph | Seed on first run |
| **Self-Description** | Every K-Block explains its own derivation | Required `derivations_from` field |
| **Illumination** | System shows, never asks | No interview-style prompts |
| **Extension** | User declarations derive from existing nodes | `derivations_from` must be non-empty |
| **Mirror Sovereignty** | L0/L1 axioms require only Mirror Test | No Toulmin proof for L0/L1 |

### 7.2 Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Why Harmful |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Interrogation** | "Tell me about yourself" | Extractive, blocks flow |
| **Blank Canvas** | Empty state awaiting input | Paralysis, no guidance |
| **Configuration** | "Set your preferences" | Dead before it starts |
| **Mandatory Fields** | "Required: your values" | Coercion, not discovery |
| **Serial Questions** | Q1 → Q2 → Q3 | Dependencies block flow |
| **Hidden Structure** | System knows but doesn't show | User can't learn |

## Part VIII: Verification Criteria

### 8.1 Genesis Completeness

```python
def test_genesis_completeness():
    """All layers are seeded with K-Blocks."""
    graph = await genesis.seed_constitutional_graph()

    # L0: 4 axioms
    assert len(graph.get_layer(0)) == 4

    # L1: 7 primitives
    assert len(graph.get_layer(1)) == 7

    # L2: 7 principles
    assert len(graph.get_layer(2)) == 7

    # L3: 4 architecture patterns
    assert len(graph.get_layer(3)) == 4

    # Total: 22 K-Blocks
    assert len(graph.nodes) == 22
```

### 8.2 Derivation Integrity

```python
def test_derivation_integrity():
    """All derivation edges are valid."""
    graph = await genesis.seed_constitutional_graph()

    for node in graph.nodes.values():
        # Every derivation_from must exist
        for d in node.derivations_from:
            assert d in graph.nodes, f"{node.id} derives from non-existent {d}"

        # L0 has no derivations_from
        if node.layer == 0:
            assert node.derivations_from == []

        # L1+ must derive from something
        if node.layer > 0:
            assert len(node.derivations_from) > 0
```

### 8.3 Galois Loss Bounds

```python
def test_galois_loss_bounds():
    """Loss bounds are respected per layer."""
    graph = await genesis.seed_constitutional_graph()

    for node in graph.nodes.values():
        if node.layer == 0:
            assert node.proof is None  # Axioms have no proof
        elif node.layer == 1:
            assert node.proof.galois_loss < 0.05  # Near fixed-point
        elif node.layer == 2:
            assert node.proof.galois_loss < 0.50  # Categorical
        elif node.layer == 3:
            assert node.proof.galois_loss < 0.50  # Architectural
```

### 8.4 First-Run Experience

```python
def test_first_run_experience():
    """Genesis creates valid first-run state."""
    # Fresh instance
    instance = await kgents.create_fresh()

    # Constitutional Graph is present
    graph = await instance.genesis.manifest()
    assert len(graph.nodes) == 22

    # User can traverse
    l0 = graph.get_layer(0)
    assert len(l0) == 4

    # User can extend
    declaration = "Build software that feels alive"
    user_axiom = await instance.genesis.extend(
        declaration=declaration,
        derivations=["genesis:L0:entity", "genesis:L0:mirror"],
    )
    assert user_axiom.layer == 1  # User declarations are L1
    assert user_axiom.proof is None  # Mirror Test only
```

## Part IX: Connection to Principles

| Principle | How Genesis Embodies It |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **Tasteful** | 22 K-Blocks only—minimal but complete |
| **Curated** | Each K-Block earns its place through derivation |
| **Ethical** | User explores, not interrogated |
| **Joy-Inducing** | Discovery, not configuration |
| **Composable** | Graph structure enables traversal and extension |
| **Heterarchical** | No K-Block is privileged—all derive from axioms |
| **Generative** | Constitutional Graph regenerates understanding |

---

## Closing Meditation

Genesis is not the beginning of a journey toward knowledge.
Genesis is the revelation that knowledge already exists.

The Constitutional Graph is not empty, waiting to be filled.
It is full, waiting to be discovered.

The user does not configure the system.
The system illuminates itself—and the user, exploring, understands.

> *"The garden knows itself. The system teaches itself. The user discovers alongside."*
