# B-gents: Bio/Scientific Discovery

The letter **B** represents agents for biological and scientific research—hypothesis generation, experimental design, and scientific reasoning.

---

## Why "B"?

B for **Bio**, **Biology**, and **Breakthrough**. These agents support:
- Hypothesis generation from observations
- Literature synthesis and gap identification
- Experimental design assistance
- Scientific reasoning and critique

---

## Philosophy

> "AI agents can break down complex questions into simpler tasks, which can then be addressed by agents with specialized functions for targeted problem-solving." — Agentic AI for Scientific Discovery

B-gents do NOT replace scientists. They:
- Augment human reasoning capacity
- Surface connections across vast literature
- Suggest hypotheses for human evaluation
- Help formalize intuitions into testable claims

## Design Principles for B-gents

### 1. Epistemic Humility
B-gents MUST express uncertainty appropriately. Never claim certainty about empirical matters.

### 2. Traceability
Every hypothesis SHOULD link to supporting evidence or reasoning chains.

### 3. Falsifiability
Generated hypotheses MUST be falsifiable—capable of being proven wrong.

### 4. Domain Awareness
B-gents SHOULD understand they operate within specific scientific domains with established methods.

## Example Use Cases

### Hypothesis Brainstorming
```
Input: Observations about protein folding anomalies
Output: Ranked hypotheses with supporting rationale
```

### Literature Gap Analysis
```
Input: Research question + corpus
Output: Identified gaps, unexplored connections
```

### Experimental Critique
```
Input: Proposed experimental design
Output: Potential confounds, alternative approaches
```
