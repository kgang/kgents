## The B-gent Meta-Heterarchy

B-gents encompass agents dealing with **resource flows** and **selection pressures**:

| Domain | Resource | Conservation | Selection |
|--------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Bio** | Attention, experiments | Energy | Falsifiability |
| **Banker** | Tokens, compute | Value | Efficiency |
| **Bootstrap** (via Ground) | Facts, context | Truth | Relevance |

These are not separate categories—they are **facets of the same structure**: systems that must allocate limited capacity across competing needs.

---

## Why "B" for Both?

**B for Bio**: Biological and scientific reasoning, hypothesis generation, experimental design.

**B for Banker**: Economic metabolism, token management, resource allocation.

Both share:
1. **Conservation laws**: Energy/value is neither created nor destroyed
2. **Selection mechanisms**: Falsifiability/efficiency filters what survives
3. **Metabolic patterns**: Consumption, transformation, waste
4. **Ecosystem dynamics**: Competition, cooperation, niche filling

The alphabetical taxonomy reveals **structural similarities** across seemingly different domains.

## The Heterarchy Principle Applied

Traditional taxonomies are hierarchical: Bio ⊃ Scientific ⊃ Hypothesis.

The B-gent heterarchy allows multiple valid organizations:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │     B-gents     │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
       ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
       │                     │                     │
  ┌────▼────┐          ┌────▼────┐          ┌────▼────┐

  └────┬────┘          └────┬────┘          └─────────┘
       │                    │
  HypothesisEngine     CentralBank
  Robin                Metered Functor
  Bio-gent             Futures Market
```

But also valid:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │ Resource Agents │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
       ┌─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┐
       │                     │                     │
  ┌────▼────┐          ┌────▼────┐          ┌────▼────┐
  │Cognitive │          │ Economic │          │Entropic │
  │Resources │          │Resources │          │Resources│
  └────┬────┘          └────┬────┘          └────┬────┘
       │                    │                    │
  B-Bio                B-Banker              Bootstrap
  (attention)          (tokens)             (entropy)
```

The letter "B" holds both views simultaneously.

## Design Principles for B-gents

### 1. Conservation Awareness
B-gents MUST respect conservation laws:
- Bio: Energy can transform but not appear/disappear
- Banker: Tokens circulate but total is conserved

### 2. Selection Pressure
B-gents MUST implement selection:
- Bio: Hypotheses must be falsifiable
- Banker: Allocations must be efficient

### 3. Metabolic Honesty
B-gents MUST track consumption:
- Bio: What cognitive resources were spent?
- Banker: What tokens were consumed?

### 4. Ecosystem Awareness
B-gents SHOULD understand their context:
- Bio: What domain are we reasoning in?
- Banker: What other agents are competing?

---

## The Unified View

At the deepest level, B-gents are about **thermodynamics**:

```
Free Energy → Useful Work + Waste

Bio:    Attention → Insights + Failed Hypotheses
Banker: Tokens    → Results  + Spent Compute
```

Both domains transform a scarce resource into valuable output plus inevitable waste. The principles of thermodynamics apply to both.

## Meta-Heterarchy: Future B-gents

The "B" genus can accommodate future facets:

- **B-Bayesian**: Probabilistic reasoning resources
- **B-Bandwidth**: Communication channel allocation
- **B-Buffer**: Memory and caching economics

All would share the core B-gent structure: conservation, selection, metabolism.
