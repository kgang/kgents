# K8-gents Research Directions

This directory contains speculative ideas that are **not part of the spec**. These are research directions that may inform future versions.

**Rule**: Ideas stay here until validated. Moving something to the main spec requires:
1. Demonstrated need (not hypothetical)
2. Principle alignment verified
3. Implementation feasibility proven

## Contents

- `horizon.md` - 10-month production scale roadmap (speculative)

## Why Separate?

From `spec/principles.md`:

> "Spec captures judgment... A generative spec beats extensive docs."

Speculative ideas that haven't been validated aren't spec—they're research. Mixing them creates false confidence in a roadmap that hasn't been proven.

The spec should describe:
- What exists
- What will be built in the next iteration

Not:
- What we might need in 10 months
- Ideas we haven't validated
