# S-gents: Studio Genus

> *"Art is not what you see, but what you make others see."*

The S-gent genus encompasses **creative production systems** — agents that transform raw materials into creative and art assets through archaeological extraction, vision synthesis, and asset production.

---

## The Studio

| Agent | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **Studio** | Creative Production Studio | Draft |

---

## Core Insight

The Studio is a **two-functor pipeline**:

```
AestheticArchaeologyFunctor : RawMaterial → CreativeVision
AssetProductionFunctor      : CreativeVision → Assets
```

This separates:
- **Understanding** (what already exists, what it means)
- **Creating** (what should exist, how to make it)

---

## Supersedes

The S-gent genus supersedes and absorbs:

| Defunct System | What's Absorbed |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Atelier (extinct) | Commission workflow, gallery |
| Metaphysical Forge (never implemented) | K-gent governance, visual language |
| Sprite Lab (pilots) | Character asset creation |
| Art Pipeline (pilots) | Build tooling, export |
