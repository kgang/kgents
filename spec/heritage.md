## The Extension: Polyfunctor Category Theory

kgents **extends** the heritage papers with rigorous mathematical foundations:

### What the Papers Lack

| Gap | kgents Extension |
|-----|------------------|
| Ad-hoc agent composition | Category-theoretic morphisms with laws |
| Static agent structure | PolyAgent state machines |
| Undefined interaction grammar | Operad composition rules |
| No coherence guarantees | Sheaf conditions for global consistency |
| No self-modification | Autopoietic deployment |

### The kgents Additions

1. **PolyAgent[S, A, B]**: Agents as polynomial functors with modes
2. **Operads**: Grammar that generates valid interactions
3. **Sheaves**: Local-to-global coherence
4. **Proprioception**: Agents sensing their own operation
5. **Autopoiesis**: Agents modifying their own code

---

## Citation Practice

When writing kgents specs or implementations, cite heritage when:

1. **Adopting a concept**: "Following Simulacra, we implement reflection as..."
2. **Extending a concept**: "Extending Voyager's skill library, we add..."
3. **Diverging from a concept**: "Unlike ChatDev's linear chat chain, we use..."

Example:
```python
class HolographicMemory:
    """
    Memory architecture following Simulacra's three-tier model,
    extended with holographic interference patterns (M-gent spec).

    Heritage: arXiv:2304.03442 §3.2 (Memory and Retrieval)
    Extension: spec/m-gents/holographic.md
    """
```

## The Debt We Owe

These papers represent years of research, millions of dollars, and countless hours of human effort. kgents exists because they exist. We owe:

1. **Acknowledgment**: Cite them prominently
2. **Extension**: Build on their foundations, don't just copy
3. **Contribution**: Publish our extensions for others to build on
4. **Gratitude**: `void.gratitude.tithe`
