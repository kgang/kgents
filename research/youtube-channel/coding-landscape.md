### What It Is

Reaction content, hot takes, and commentary on:
- Framework debates (React vs. Svelte vs. HTMX)
- Big Tech layoffs and hiring practices
- Language/tool controversies
- Influencer conflicts
- Industry scandals

### Why It Works

> "Fans have become 'digital biographers': tracking relationships, analyzing 'dramas,' and even suggesting new challenge arcs in the comments, making them co-creators of the plot."

| Driver | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Parasocial engagement | Viewers feel part of the community |
| Lower production barrier | React to existing content |
| Algorithm favorability | High engagement signals |
| Repeat viewership | Drama arcs keep people returning |

### Key Players

- **ThePrimeagen** - Master of spicy takes and reactions
- **Fireship** - Commentary disguised as news
- **Various smaller channels** - Riding controversy waves

### Opportunity/Risk

**Opportunity**: Easy way to generate views, builds personality brand
**Risk**: Can become negative/toxic, burns bridges, ages poorly
