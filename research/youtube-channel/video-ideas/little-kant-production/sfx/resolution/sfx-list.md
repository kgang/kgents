## Tone Notes

This scene should feel WARMER than everything before. The same sounds but with:
- Slightly more reverb (warmth)
- Less high-frequency harshness
- Slower, more relaxed pacing
- Ambient bed should feel "golden hour"

The contrast with the cold industrial space of Act Three is essential.
