## COLD OPEN

### SCENE 0: DEPARTURE
**[Context: A quiet German bedroom. A boy leaving everything behind.]**

---

[soft, barely audible, satisfied]
**KANT:** There.

---

## TITLE CARD

[neutral, simple statement]
**NARRATOR:** Little Kant.

---

## ACT ONE: THE ARRIVAL

### SCENE 1B: THE PARKING LOT
**[Context: High school parking lot. Lunch period. Two kids on a van roof, watching the world.]**

---

[casual, observational, mouth slightly full]
**DIOGENES:** The lacrosse guys are fighting again.

[mild curiosity]
**CAROL:** Which ones?

[dismissive shrug in voice]
**DIOGENES:** Does it matter?

[considering, then agreeing]
**CAROL:** ... Not really.

---

[noticing, neutral]
**DIOGENES:** New kid.

[certain, simple]
**CAROL:** German.

[curious]
**DIOGENES:** How do you know?

[observant, listing evidence]
**CAROL:** The book... The posture... The way he's NOT trying to look busy.

[genuinely interested now]
**DIOGENES:** He's just sitting there. ... Reading.

[simple confirmation]
**CAROL:** Yeah.

[approving, impressed]
**DIOGENES:** That's kind of tight.

---

[starting to suggest]
**CAROL:** Should we...

[cutting off, philosophical certainty]
**DIOGENES:** Nah. ... If he's one of us, ... he'll FIND us.

[gentle challenge]
**CAROL:** And if he's not?

[matter-of-fact]
**DIOGENES:** Then he won't.

---

**[Context: Kant has walked over. Standing at the van's bumper. Not looking up.]**

[not looking down, testing]
**DIOGENES:** You need something?

[measured, 1.5 second pause before speaking, honest]
**KANT:** ... No.

[probing]
**DIOGENES:** Then why are you here?

[genuinely uncertain, thoughtful]
**KANT:** ... I don't know yet.

---

[surprised, to himself]
**DIOGENES:** You're not scared of us.

[neutral, curious]
**KANT:** ... Should I be?

[to Carol, delighted disbelief]
**DIOGENES:** He's NOT scared of us.

[dry confirmation]
**CAROL:** I noticed.

[explaining, to Kant]
**DIOGENES:** Most people don't come over.

[simple statement of fact]
**KANT:** ... I'm not most people.

[very dry, almost amused]
**CAROL:** Obviously.

---

[offering]
**DIOGENES:** You gonna stand there?

[practical question]
**KANT:** ... Is there somewhere else to sit?

---

**[Context: Kant sits on a crate. Comfortable silence. Watching the school together.]**

[gentle curiosity]
**CAROL:** What were you reading?

[factual]
**KANT:** Kant.

[no reaction, casual]
**CAROL:** Any good?

[considering deeply, 2 second pause, then measured delivery]
**KANT:** ... ... He's very CERTAIN about things.

[amused snort, curious]
**DIOGENES:** Is that good or bad?

[honest uncertainty]
**KANT:** ... I haven't decided.

---

[informational, not inviting]
**DIOGENES:** We stay through sixth period. ... It's a free.

[getting up, neutral]
**KANT:** I have class.

[simple, warm]
**CAROL:** Tomorrow, then.

[non-committal]
**KANT:** Maybe.

---

[watching him go, certain]
**DIOGENES:** He'll be back.

[agreeing]
**CAROL:** Yeah.

[curious]
**DIOGENES:** How do you know?

[simple wisdom, warm]
**CAROL:** ... He sat down.

---

## ACT TWO: THE EVIL DEMON APPEARS

### SCENE 2: THE SHIFT
**[Context: School hallway. End of day. Reality becomes wrong. Lights flicker. Too quiet.]**

---

[layered voices - one clear, whispers underneath, curious not threatening]
**DEMON:** You made a choice today.

[unrattled, turning slowly]
**KANT:** ... I sat with some people.

[gently mocking, curious]
**DEMON:** Is that what you call it?

[challenging back]
**KANT:** ... What would YOU call it?

[almost amused, knowing]
**DEMON:** The beginning of something... you can't take back.

---

[direct]
**KANT:** ... What do you want?

[inviting, ominous but curious]
**DEMON:** To show you... what you're REALLY choosing.

---

[reality shifting, voice gaining resonance]
**DEMON:** Everyone thinks about the trolley problem. ... But nobody really... CHOOSES.

[pause building tension]
**DEMON:** ... Until now.

---

## ACT THREE: THE TROLLEY PROBLEM

### SCENE 3A: THE SETUP
**[Context: Industrial nightmare space. Cold. Echoing. Railroad tracks. A train approaching - The Grief Engine.]**

---

[narrating space into existence, theatrical]
**DEMON:** The Greater Good Express.

[clinical, setting the scene]
**DEMON:** Fifteen on the main track. ... Two on the side. ... The lever... is between.

---

[analytical, testing reality]
**KANT:** ... This isn't real.

[philosophical challenge]
**DEMON:** Reality is what you CHOOSE to do.

[dismissive]
**KANT:** ... That's not an answer.

[pressing, intense]
**DEMON:** It's the ONLY answer that matters. ... Fifteen. Or two. ... You know the math. ... What's the answer?

[looking at tracks, working through it]
**KANT:** ... There's no right answer.

[certain, almost smiling]
**DEMON:** There's ALWAYS an answer. ... People just don't like admitting it.

---

### SCENE 3B: THE TRACKS
**[Context: Train getting closer. Heartbeat rhythm building. People on the tracks calling out.]**

---

[clear, rational despite terror, not screaming]
**CHEERLEADER:** Pull the lever.

[angry, frustrated, obvious to him]
**JOCK:** Fifteen to two. ... That's not even a QUESTION.

[scared, pleading, desperate]
**ANOTHER KID:** Please... I don't even KNOW them.

---

**[Context: On the side track - Diogenes and Carol, calm, watching.]**

[conversational, almost bored, to Carol]
**DIOGENES:** This is new.

[dry, accepting]
**CAROL:** Yeah.

[observational, certain, to Kant]
**DIOGENES:** You're not gonna pull it.

[genuinely curious]
**KANT:** ... How do you know?

[simple, profound]
**DIOGENES:** Because you sat down.

[confused]
**CAROL:** That doesn't make sense.

[certain]
**DIOGENES:** It makes PERFECT sense.

---

### SCENE 3C: THE CHOICE
**[Context: Train closer. Wheels on tracks. Heartbeat faster. Time running out.]**

---

[impatient, pressing]
**DEMON:** Clock's ticking.

[measured, working through ethics aloud]
**KANT:** ... If I pull the lever... I KILL them.

[challenging]
**DEMON:** If you DON'T... they DIE.

[pause, finding the distinction, slow and careful]
**KANT:** ... There's a difference.

[skeptical]
**DEMON:** IS there?

[building argument, speaking slowly - working it out in real time, gaining conviction]
**KANT:** I didn't CREATE this. ... You did. ... Whatever happens on that track... the TRAIN is killing them. ... Not me. ... But if I pull this lever... ... I'm the one who decides who dies. ... I BECOME part of it.

[dismissive]
**DEMON:** That's just philosophy.

[quiet, certain, final]
**KANT:** ... It's all I have.

---

**[Context: Kant steps back from the lever. Fifteen students scream. Train accelerates - then STOPS. Silence.]**

---

[after long pause, something shifted, genuinely curious now]
**DEMON:** You'd let fifteen people die... for two strangers.

[firm, correcting, precise]
**KANT:** I'd REFUSE to kill two people... for fifteen strangers. ... It's not the same thing.

[longer pause, the layered whispers settle, something like respect]
**DEMON:** ... ... Interesting.

---

## RESOLUTION

### SCENE 4: THE RETURN
**[Context: Normal hallway again. End of day. Like nothing happened. Kant at his locker.]**

---

[casual greeting, seeing him]
**DIOGENES:** Oh. ... You again.

[flat, matching energy]
**KANT:** ... Me again.

[informational, not inviting]
**CAROL:** We're going to the van.

---

**[Context: Three sets of footsteps. Walking together toward the parking lot.]**

[observant]
**DIOGENES:** You look weird.

[understated]
**KANT:** ... I had a strange afternoon.

[gently therapeutic]
**CAROL:** Want to talk about it?

[pause, definite]
**KANT:** ... No.

[approving, genuine]
**DIOGENES:** Good answer.

---

## TAG

### SCENE 5: THE JOKE
**[Context: Sunset. Van roof. Parking lot nearly empty. Three people sitting together. Comfortable silence.]**

---

[casual curiosity, conversational]
**CAROL:** You ever think about the trolley problem?

[groaning, dismissive]
**DIOGENES:** No.

[to Kant, curious]
**CAROL:** You?

[2 second pause, then matter-of-fact]
**KANT:** ... ... Sometimes.

[probing gently]
**CAROL:** What would you do?

[PERFECTLY deadpan, no warmth, stating a fact]
**KANT:** ... Kill you both.

---

[shocked]
**CAROL:** ... What?

[same deadpan, explaining like it's obvious]
**KANT:** Fifteen is greater than two. ... The math is simple.

---

**[Context: They stare at him. Long, uncomfortable silence. 4 full seconds.]**

---

[the TINIEST smile creeping in, warmth entering for first time]
**KANT:** ... ... ... ... That was a joke.

[exhaling hard, relieved barking laugh]
**DIOGENES:** JESUS.

[impressed, laughing]
**CAROL:** Your delivery is INSANE.

[dry, hint of warmth]
**KANT:** I'm working on it.

[still laughing, genuine]
**DIOGENES:** DON'T. ... Keep it EXACTLY like that.

---

## POST-CREDITS STING

### SCENE 6: THE WATCHERS
**[Context: Office. Quiet. Clinical. Someone reviewing a file.]**

---

[completely clinical, no emotion, detached]
**UNKNOWN VOICE:** Subject identified.

[same clinical tone, an order]
**UNKNOWN VOICE:** ... Tag him.

## ELEVENLABS PRODUCTION NOTES

### Pacing Key
- `...` = 0.5 second pause
- `... ...` = 1 second pause
- `... ... ...` = 1.5 second pause
- `... ... ... ...` = 2 second pause (use for Kant's characteristic hesitation)
- CAPS = emphasis (louder, slightly slower)
- Commas = micro-pause, breath opportunity
- Periods = full stop, reset

### Emotion Tag Guide
Tags in brackets before lines indicate the emotional tone for that line:
- Read the tag, embody the emotion, deliver the line
- Multiple tags mean blend (e.g., [dry, amused] = dry delivery with hint of amusement)
- Mid-line tone shifts noted in description

### Character-Specific Direction

**KANT:**
- ALWAYS pause 1-2 seconds before responding (use `... ...` before his lines)
- Flat affect throughout EXCEPT when making jokes
- When joking: the warmth is subtle - a slight softening, not a different voice
- Speaks like translating from German - precise word choice, no filler words
- Never says "I feel like" - says "I think" or "I observe"

**DIOGENES:**
- Casual about everything, even profound statements
- Barking laugh = sharp, sudden, genuine
- Sometimes sounds like he's eating (mouth slightly full)
- Rough/gravelly texture throughout
- Comfortable with silence

**CAROL:**
- Warm baseline, therapeutic rhythm
- Can shift fierce on a single word
- Notices before she speaks (small pauses for observation)
- "Want to talk about it?" comes naturally
- Gentle but never weak

**DEMON:**
- Layer effect: One clear voice, whispered echoes underneath (add in post-production)
- Curious, not menacing - asking questions, not threatening
- Pacing is deliberate - let words land
- Not the devil - more like a philosophical mirror

**UNKNOWN VOICE:**
- Maximum clinical detachment
- No emotion whatsoever
- Short, clipped delivery
- Unsettling through absence of feeling

### Scene Context Notes
Each scene header includes `[Context: ...]` to help the voice AI understand:
- Physical setting
- Emotional state of the scene
- What just happened / what's at stake

This context should inform delivery even if not spoken aloud.

### Technical Settings Recommendations

**For dramatic scenes (Trolley Problem):**
- Stability: Lower (0.40-0.60) for more emotional variation
- Style: Higher (0.30-0.50) for more expressiveness

**For quiet scenes (Van conversations):**
- Stability: Higher (0.60-0.80) for consistency
- Style: Lower (0.15-0.25) for naturalism

**For Kant's characteristic pauses:**
- Generate the pause as silence in the audio
- Don't rely on punctuation alone
- Consider generating Kant's lines in shorter segments with manual pause insertion

### Post-Production Notes
1. **Demon voice:** Layer 2-3 whispered tracks underneath main voice, offset by 0.1-0.2 seconds
2. **Reality shift:** Add subtle pitch/speed variations when entering/exiting philosophy-space
3. **The joke (Scene 5):** Kant's delivery must be indistinguishable from his serious lines until "That was a joke"
4. **Train sounds:** Mix heartbeat rhythm underneath dialogue in Scene 3
