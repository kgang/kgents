# LITTLE KANT
## "A Life (Well) Lived"
### Pilot Episode — Writer's Room Draft

---

**VERSION:** v6.0 — Dense Dialogue + Character Method + Hyperbolized Concepts
**DATE:** 2026-01-11
**PURPOSE:** This document is for WRITERS, not production. It shows the method behind every beat.

---

## CORE THESIS (Hyperbolized)

**THE SHOW'S ARGUMENT:** You are not your actions. You are not your consequences. You are the PRINCIPLE by which you choose. Everything else is noise.

**THE PILOT'S ARGUMENT:** Sitting down with strangers is a moral act. Choosing not to kill is different from letting die. Jokes only land when they cost something.

**THE EMOTIONAL ARC:** Isolation → Recognition → Testing → Refusal → Belonging

---

## CHARACTER METHOD SHEETS

Before we write dialogue, we understand WHO is speaking.

### IMMANUEL KANT

**OBJECTIVE (What he wants):** To find consistency in an inconsistent world.

**OBSTACLE (What stops him):** The world rewards inconsistency. People make exceptions for themselves constantly. This causes him genuine, almost physical discomfort.

**TACTIC (How he pursues his objective):** He tests every action against universalizability. Silently, constantly. "Could everyone do this?" is not a question—it's a filter through which he sees reality.

**SECRET (What he doesn't say):** He's terrified of being alone forever. His precision isn't coldness—it's a wall. If he's consistent, he can't be rejected for who he IS, only for what he believes. That feels safer.

**SUPERPOWER:** He can hold a principle even when it costs him everything.

**KRYPTONITE:** He can't bend. When bending would save him, he breaks instead.

**PHYSICAL LIFE:** Moves precisely. No wasted motion. Pauses before speaking—he's translating from German in his head, but also checking whether what he's about to say is TRUE. Hands often clasped or in pockets. Rarely gestures.

**VOICE:** Formal. Complete sentences. Never says "like" or "I feel like." Says "I think" or "I observe." His rare jokes land because they're delivered with zero affect—you can't tell he's joking until he wants you to.

---

### DIOGENES

**OBJECTIVE (What they want):** To strip away everything that isn't necessary and see what's left.

**OBSTACLE (What stops them):** People are addicted to pretense. They can't hear truth without performing a reaction to it.

**TACTIC (How they pursue their objective):** Provocation. Diogenes says the thing nobody will say. Does the thing nobody will do. Not to be cruel—to see what happens. To find out what's real.

**SECRET (What they don't say):** They're afraid that if they stripped away EVERYTHING, there'd be nothing left. No self. Just needs and responses. So they keep one thing: the flashlight. The search for an honest person. That search is the self.

**SUPERPOWER:** Complete freedom from social expectation. They literally do not care what you think.

**KRYPTONITE:** They can't connect without vulnerability, and vulnerability feels like pretense.

**PHYSICAL LIFE:** Loose. Takes up space without apology. Eats while talking. Sits in ways furniture wasn't designed for. Carries the flashlight always—clips it to their belt, holds it, points it at things.

**VOICE:** Direct. Short sentences when cutting through bullshit. Longer when genuinely curious. Barking laugh—sudden, loud, genuine. Sometimes sounds bored even when interested.

---

### CAROL GILLIGAN

**OBJECTIVE (What she wants):** For everyone to be seen. For no one to be left out of the conversation.

**OBSTACLE (What stops her):** People don't want to be seen. They want to win arguments. Seeing each other requires slowing down, and the world rewards speed.

**TACTIC (How she pursues her objective):** She notices. Before anyone speaks, she's already reading the room—who's comfortable, who's not, who's being ignored. She names what she sees. "You look like you're carrying something."

**SECRET (What she doesn't say):** She notices everyone except herself. She doesn't know what SHE needs. She's afraid that if she looked, she'd find something unlovable.

**SUPERPOWER:** She can name the feeling you didn't know you were having.

**KRYPTONITE:** She can't say no. Boundaries feel like abandonment.

**PHYSICAL LIFE:** Present. Eye contact. Sits at your level—if you're on the floor, she's on the floor. Touches appropriately—hand on arm, shoulder. Leans in when listening.

**VOICE:** Warm. Questions before statements. "How are you feeling about that?" She means it. The shift to fierce is sudden—voice drops, pace slows, the warmth becomes heat.

---

### THE EVIL DEMON

**OBJECTIVE (What it wants):** To reveal. Not deceive—reveal.

**OBSTACLE (What stops it):** People lie to themselves. They won't look at what it shows them.

**TACTIC (How it pursues its objective):** It strips away context. No comfortable excuses. No "but the situation was complicated." Just: here is the choice. What do you do?

**SECRET (What it doesn't say):** It's lonely. It's been asking these questions for centuries. No one ever has a new answer. Kant's answer—the distinction between killing and letting die—is genuinely new to it. That's why it says "interesting."

**VOICE:** Layered. One clear voice, several whispers beneath. Not threatening—curious. Patient. It has all the time in the world.

---

## ACT ONE: THE ARRIVAL

### SCENE 1A: OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL
**Runtime: 45 seconds**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** Establish Kant as observer, not participant. He moves through the world without being OF it.

**BEAT MAP:**
1. Chaos (the world)
2. Stillness (Kant)
3. Brief contact (the nod)
4. Alone again (the walk)

---

*No dialogue. This is visual/ambient storytelling.*

*The audience sees: a kid who isn't performing. Everyone else is—laughing too loud, walking in groups, checking phones. Kant just... walks.*

*One moment: a JOCK makes eye contact. Neutral nod. Kant returns it. Nothing more. This is important—Kant isn't REJECTED by the social world. He opts out.*

---

### SCENE 1B: THE PARKING LOT — LUNCH
**Runtime: 2 minutes**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** The misfits find each other. Not through a "moment" but through accumulated recognition. They're cool because they've opted out, not because they're performing coolness.

**BEAT MAP:**
1. Kant alone, reading—content (establishes: he doesn't NEED them)
2. Diogenes and Carol on the van—watching, also content (establishes: they don't NEED him)
3. Recognition (Carol clocks the book)
4. Observation (they discuss him without performing)
5. Decision (Kant walks over—HE chooses)
6. Testing (the dialogue)
7. Acceptance (no fanfare, just: "Tomorrow, then")

**THE HYPERBOLIZED CONCEPT:** Choosing to sit down with strangers is a moral act. It's not "making friends"—it's declaring: I am willing to be seen by you.

---

**[THE VAN — DIOGENES AND CAROL]**

*Diogenes is on the roof, shirtless or close to it, eating an apple, watching the school like it's a nature documentary. Carol is next to them, notebook open, making a web diagram of something.*

**DIOGENES:** The lacrosse guys are fighting again.

**CAROL:** Which ones?

**DIOGENES:** Tyler and the other Tyler.

**CAROL:** There's a third Tyler.

**DIOGENES:** There's always a third Tyler.

*Beat. They watch.*

**DIOGENES:** Twenty bucks one of them cries.

**CAROL:** That's mean.

**DIOGENES:** It's an observation. Observations aren't mean.

**CAROL:** Betting on someone's pain is mean.

**DIOGENES:** *(considering this)* Fair. Ten bucks.

**CAROL:** *(dry)* That's not better.

**DIOGENES:** I'm meeting you halfway.

*Beat. They go back to watching.*

**DIOGENES:** New kid.

*Carol glances toward Kant, sitting on a bench across the lot. Reading.*

**CAROL:** German.

**DIOGENES:** How do you know?

**CAROL:** The book's in German. Or the posture. Or the way he's not performing "casual."

**DIOGENES:** What do you mean?

**CAROL:** Everyone here is doing something for someone. Checking their phone for someone. Laughing for someone. Walking a certain way for someone. He's just... sitting there.

**DIOGENES:** *(interested now)* Reading.

**CAROL:** Yeah.

**DIOGENES:** By himself.

**CAROL:** Yeah.

**DIOGENES:** That's kind of tight.

*Beat.*

**CAROL:** Should we—

**DIOGENES:** No.

**CAROL:** You don't know what I was going to say.

**DIOGENES:** You were going to say "should we go talk to him" or "should we wave him over" or something. And no.

**CAROL:** Why not?

**DIOGENES:** Because if we recruit him, he's ours. If he finds us, he's his.

**CAROL:** *(pause)* That's actually...

**DIOGENES:** Smart? Wise? Philosophically coherent?

**CAROL:** I was going to say "less dumb than usual."

**DIOGENES:** *(grinning)* I'll take it.

*They watch. Kant finishes a chapter. Looks up. Notices them for the first time—really notices. Two kids on a van, watching the school like it's beneath them.*

*He makes a decision. Gets up. Walks over.*

---

**[AT THE VAN]**

*Kant stops at the bumper. Looks up at them. Doesn't ask permission.*

**DIOGENES:** *(not looking down)* You need something?

**KANT:** *(two-second pause before answering—this is his rhythm)* No.

**DIOGENES:** Then why are you here?

**KANT:** I haven't determined that yet.

*Diogenes looks down now. Studies him.*

**DIOGENES:** That's a weird answer.

**KANT:** It's an honest one.

**DIOGENES:** *(to Carol)* He's weird.

**CAROL:** Mm-hmm.

**DIOGENES:** *(to Kant)* You're not scared of us.

**KANT:** Should I be?

**DIOGENES:** Most people are.

**KANT:** I'm not most people.

**CAROL:** *(dry)* Clearly.

*Beat. Nobody's performing anything. This is the test—can he exist in silence without filling it?*

*Kant can. He just stands there. Waiting.*

**DIOGENES:** *(finally)* There's a crate.

*He gestures vaguely. There is, in fact, a plastic crate near the van. Kant sits on it.*

*Silence. They watch the school. Kant watches too.*

**CAROL:** What were you reading?

**KANT:** Kant.

**CAROL:** *(no reaction)* Any relation?

**KANT:** *(pause—is this a joke? he decides to answer literally)* My parents have a sense of humor.

**DIOGENES:** *(barking laugh)* Wait, your actual name is Kant?

**KANT:** Immanuel Kant. Yes.

**DIOGENES:** And you're reading... Kant.

**KANT:** Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals. Yes.

**CAROL:** Is it good?

**KANT:** *(considers—two seconds)* He's very certain about things.

**DIOGENES:** Is that good or bad?

**KANT:** I haven't decided.

*Beat. Nothing more. A distant bell rings.*

**DIOGENES:** We stay through sixth period. It's a free.

*It's not an invitation. It's information. Kant can do what he wants with it.*

**KANT:** *(getting up)* I have class.

**CAROL:** Tomorrow, then.

**KANT:** Maybe.

*He walks away. Doesn't look back.*

**DIOGENES:** *(watching him go)* He'll be back.

**CAROL:** Yeah.

**DIOGENES:** How do you know?

**CAROL:** *(simply)* He sat down.

**DIOGENES:** So?

**CAROL:** So he had to decide to do that. Nobody sits with us by accident.

*Beat.*

**DIOGENES:** Fair.

---

## ACT TWO: THE EVIL DEMON APPEARS

### SCENE 2: THE SHIFT
**Runtime: 1.5 minutes**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** Transition from normal to uncanny. The Demon emerges from Kant's own questioning—it's not external, it's what happens when you take your own thoughts seriously.

**BEAT MAP:**
1. Normalcy (locker, end of day)
2. The question forming (internal)
3. Reality responding (the flicker)
4. The Demon appears (not as threat—as consequence)
5. The challenge posed

**THE HYPERBOLIZED CONCEPT:** The Demon is not supernatural. The Demon is what happens when you actually THINK about what you believe. Most people never meet it because they never think hard enough.

---

*Kant at his locker. End of day. Putting books away with characteristic precision.*

*His hands slow. He's thinking about something.*

**KANT:** *(to himself, barely audible)* He sat down.

*Beat. He's replaying Carol's words.*

**KANT:** *(still to himself)* He had to decide to do that. Nobody sits with us by accident.

*He closes his locker. Stands there.*

**KANT:** *(internal logic, working it out)* So sitting down was a choice. An action with moral weight. I chose to associate with them. Which means I chose to... what? Accept their framework? Become responsible for them? Become implicated in their—

*The lights flicker.*

*He doesn't react. He's still thinking.*

**KANT:** —in their fate. If something happens to them, I'm now... connected. I made a choice.

*The hallway is empty. Too empty. When did everyone leave?*

**DEMON:** *(voice comes from everywhere—one clear tone, whispers underneath)* You're thinking about it correctly.

*Kant doesn't startle. He turns slowly. The Demon is there—made of reflections, mirrors, not fully solid.*

**KANT:** You're not real.

**DEMON:** *(almost amused)* Neither is obligation. Neither is duty. Neither is the categorical imperative. And yet you live by them.

**KANT:** *(pause)* What are you?

**DEMON:** I'm what happens when you take your own thoughts seriously. Most people never meet me. They stop before it gets uncomfortable.

**KANT:** And I didn't stop.

**DEMON:** You never do. That's what makes you interesting.

*Beat. They regard each other.*

**DEMON:** You made a choice today. You sat down with strangers. You declared yourself connected to them. Responsible for them. Implicated in their fate.

**KANT:** That seems like an overstatement.

**DEMON:** Does it? You're already thinking about what you'd do if something happened to them. You're already calculating your obligations. You didn't do that yesterday.

*Beat. Kant can't deny it.*

**DEMON:** Let me show you what you're really choosing.

*Reality warps. The hallway stretches, glitches, dissolves.*

**DEMON:** Everyone knows the trolley problem. But nobody actually CHOOSES. They discuss it. They debate it. They never FACE it.

*Beat.*

**DEMON:** Until now.

---

## ACT THREE: THE TROLLEY PROBLEM

### SCENE 3A: THE SETUP
**Runtime: 1 minute**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** Make the abstract visceral. This isn't a thought experiment—this is his friends on the tracks.

**THE HYPERBOLIZED CONCEPT:** Utilitarian math is monstrous because it makes people into numbers. The number of people saved doesn't determine the rightness of the action. The PRINCIPLE determines the rightness. The principle is: you cannot use a person as a means to an end, no matter how many people you save.

---

*Industrial space. Cold. Echoing. Railroad tracks emerge from the gloom.*

*The GRIEF ENGINE approaches. It's wrong—Victorian skeleton, mechanical heartbeat, stained cowcatcher. On its side: "GREATER GOOD EXPRESS"*

**DEMON:** *(narrating the space)* Fifteen on the main track. Your classmates. The lacrosse guys. The cheerleaders. The people you haven't spoken to.

*They're there—conscious, strapped down, looking at him.*

**DEMON:** Two on the side track.

*Diogenes and Carol. Also strapped. Also conscious. Also looking at him.*

**DEMON:** The lever is between. The train is coming. What do you do?

*Kant looks at the lever. Old iron. Worn smooth—other hands have pulled it.*

**KANT:** This isn't real.

**DEMON:** Reality is what you choose to do in it. The train is coming. What do you do?

---

### SCENE 3B: THE TRACKS
**Runtime: 2 minutes**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** The utilitarian argument is made by people with genuine stakes. It's not a strawman—it's a real position, argued well. Kant has to DEFEAT it, not dismiss it.

**CHARACTER OBJECTIVES:**
- **Cheerleader:** To convince Kant through clear logic. She's not hysterical—she's making the best argument she can.
- **Jock:** To convince Kant through moral pressure. You're letting us die for THEM?
- **Diogenes:** To observe. To see what Kant actually does. Also, genuinely curious.
- **Carol:** To make Kant feel seen, regardless of what he chooses. And to gently test whether his principles hold.

---

**FROM THE MAIN TRACK:**

**CHEERLEADER:** *(clear, not screaming)* Pull the lever.

**KANT:** *(pause)* Why?

**CHEERLEADER:** Because fifteen is greater than two. I know you can do the math.

**KANT:** The math isn't the question.

**CHEERLEADER:** Then what is?

**KANT:** Whether the math determines the ethics.

**CHEERLEADER:** *(frustrated but still arguing)* If you don't pull the lever, fifteen people die. If you do, two people die. The outcome is better if you pull it. How is this complicated?

**JOCK:** *(cutting in, angry)* Forget the philosophy. You know them for what, four hours? And you'd let us die for them?

**KANT:** I'm not letting anyone die.

**JOCK:** The train is RIGHT THERE.

**KANT:** The train is killing you. Not me.

**JOCK:** If you can stop it and you don't, that's on you!

**ANOTHER KID:** *(scared, pleading)* Please. I don't know them. I don't know you. I just want to go home.

*Beat. This lands. The kid isn't making an argument—he's just scared.*

---

**FROM THE SIDE TRACK:**

**DIOGENES:** *(to Carol, conversational)* This is new.

**CAROL:** *(dry)* Yeah.

**DIOGENES:** You ever been tied to a track before?

**CAROL:** Can't say I have.

**DIOGENES:** It's uncomfortable.

**CAROL:** I noticed.

*Beat. They're genuinely not performing distress. This is unnerving.*

**DIOGENES:** *(to Kant)* You're not gonna pull it.

**KANT:** How do you know?

**DIOGENES:** Because if you were going to, you'd have done it already. You're thinking. Which means the obvious answer isn't obvious to you.

**CAROL:** *(gently, to Kant)* What are you thinking?

**KANT:** *(pause—two seconds)* I'm thinking about the difference between doing and allowing.

**CAROL:** Tell me.

**KANT:** If I don't pull the lever, the train kills them. The train is the cause. I'm a bystander who didn't intervene.

**CAROL:** And if you do pull it?

**KANT:** Then I'm the cause. I redirected the train. I chose who dies. My hands. My action.

**DIOGENES:** *(interested)* So you're saying there's a difference between killing and letting die.

**KANT:** Yes.

**CHEERLEADER:** *(from the main track)* That's just semantics! The outcome is the same!

**KANT:** *(turning to her)* The outcome is the same. The action is not.

**CHEERLEADER:** Who cares about the action? The result is what matters!

**KANT:** *(pause)* If results are all that matter, then anyone can be sacrificed at any time for the greater good. Is that the world you want?

**CHEERLEADER:** *(hesitating)* That's... that's a slippery slope.

**KANT:** It's a principle. If I pull the lever now—if I decide that two lives can be traded for fifteen—then I'm accepting a rule. And rules have to be universal. Could everyone pull the lever? In every situation? Always trade the smaller number for the larger?

**JOCK:** YES.

**KANT:** Then no one is ever safe. Because you're always potentially the smaller number.

*Beat. This lands.*

---

### SCENE 3C: THE CHOICE
**Runtime: 1.5 minutes**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** Kant refuses. Not because he doesn't care about the fifteen—but because he cares about something MORE than consequences. He cares about the principle by which he acts.

**THE HYPERBOLIZED CONCEPT:** Refusing to pull the lever is not cowardice. It's the only morally coherent position. If you accept that people can be used as means to ends—if you accept utilitarian calculation—then you've accepted that YOU can be sacrificed whenever the math works out. The only way to be safe is to refuse the math entirely.

---

*The train moves. Closer.*

**DEMON:** Clock's ticking.

**KANT:** *(looking at the lever, then at Carol)* Would you want me to pull it?

**CAROL:** *(honest)* I don't know. I'm not in a position to think clearly about it.

**KANT:** *(almost smiling)* That's honest.

**CAROL:** *(returning the almost-smile)* It's all I've got.

**DIOGENES:** *(to Kant)* What would you do if it was reversed? If we were on the main track?

**KANT:** *(pause—genuinely considering)* I wouldn't pull it.

**DIOGENES:** Even though we're your friends?

**KANT:** The number doesn't change the principle. Two or twenty or two hundred—you can't use people as means to an end.

**DIOGENES:** *(studying him)* You actually believe that.

**KANT:** Yes.

**DIOGENES:** *(to Carol)* Huh.

**CAROL:** *(to Kant, quiet)* Whatever you do... we see you.

*Beat. Kant looks at the lever one more time.*

**KANT:** *(to the Demon)* I didn't create this situation. You did.

**DEMON:** So?

**KANT:** So whatever happens on that track—it's on you. The train. The setup. The "choice." All of it. You built this. I'm just standing here.

**DEMON:** And if you could stop it?

**KANT:** I can't stop it. I can only redirect it. And redirecting it means choosing to kill them. Deliberately. With my hands. As a means to an end.

**DEMON:** To save fifteen lives.

**KANT:** *(firm)* I will not use them as instruments. I will not decide that their lives are currency. I will not become someone who trades people for people.

*He steps back from the lever.*

*The fifteen scream.*

*The train accelerates—*

*—and stops.*

*Silence. Everything freezes.*

**DEMON:** *(long pause—something has shifted)* You'd let fifteen people die.

**KANT:** I'd refuse to kill two. It's not the same.

**DEMON:** *(the whispers beneath the voice settle—it's almost respectful)* ...Interesting.

**KANT:** You've asked this before.

**DEMON:** Many times.

**KANT:** And no one's given this answer?

**DEMON:** *(pause)* Not like that. Not with that certainty.

*Reality dissolves. The tracks fade.*

**DEMON:** *(fading out)* You'll see me again.

**KANT:** I know.

---

## RESOLUTION

### SCENE 4: THE RETURN
**Runtime: 1 minute**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** Ground the abstract in the concrete. He's back. They're there. Something has changed, but nothing is explained. The belonging is real.

---

*Normal hallway. End of day. Kant is at his locker.*

*Did it happen? He looks at his hands. They're shaking slightly.*

*He closes the locker. Walks toward the exit.*

*Diogenes and Carol are by the door. Not waiting for him specifically—just there.*

**DIOGENES:** *(seeing him)* Oh. You again.

**KANT:** *(flat)* Me again.

**CAROL:** We're going to the van.

*It's not an invitation. It's information.*

**KANT:** *(pause)* Okay.

*They walk together.*

**DIOGENES:** You look weird.

**KANT:** I had a strange afternoon.

**CAROL:** *(gently)* Want to talk about it?

**KANT:** No.

**DIOGENES:** *(nodding)* Good answer.

*They walk in silence.*

**CAROL:** *(after a beat)* You ever see things? Things that aren't... exactly there?

**KANT:** *(stops walking—looks at her)* Why do you ask?

**CAROL:** *(shrugs)* Just curious.

**DIOGENES:** *(matter-of-fact)* We've all seen something.

**KANT:** Something?

**DIOGENES:** You know what I mean.

*Kant does know. He saw it. They've seen it.*

**KANT:** What did you see?

**DIOGENES:** I was asked what I'd give up to be free.

**CAROL:** I was asked who I'd hurt to protect someone.

*Beat.*

**KANT:** What did you answer?

**DIOGENES:** *(half-smiling)* I told it to get out of my sunlight.

**CAROL:** *(quiet)* I didn't answer. I'm still thinking about it.

*They keep walking. Kant is not alone.*

---

## TAG

### SCENE 5: THE JOKE
**Runtime: 45 seconds**

**DRAMATIC FUNCTION:** Release the tension. The joke only works because of what came before. Kant saying "I'd kill you both" is funny ONLY because he just refused to kill them even in an imaginary scenario.

**THE HYPERBOLIZED CONCEPT:** Humor requires stakes. A joke about the trolley problem from a stranger is mildly clever. A joke about the trolley problem from someone who JUST FACED IT and REFUSED TO PULL THE LEVER is devastating.

---

*The van. Sunset. The three of them on the roof, watching the empty parking lot.*

*Comfortable silence.*

**CAROL:** You ever think about the trolley problem?

**DIOGENES:** *(groaning)* Why.

**CAROL:** Just curious.

**DIOGENES:** It's boring. Everyone's got an answer. Nobody actually knows.

**CAROL:** *(to Kant)* What about you?

**KANT:** *(pause—two seconds)* Sometimes.

**CAROL:** What would you do?

*Beat. Kant looks at them both.*

**KANT:** *(perfectly deadpan)* Kill you both.

*Stunned silence.*

**CAROL:** ...Excuse me?

**KANT:** Fifteen is greater than two. The math is simple. The utilitarian calculus is sound.

**DIOGENES:** *(staring)* You're joking.

**KANT:** *(same flat tone)* Why would I joke about utilitarian calculus?

*Long, uncomfortable silence. Four seconds. Five.*

**KANT:** *(the smallest smile breaking through)* That was a joke.

**DIOGENES:** *(exhaling, punching Kant's arm)* JESUS.

**CAROL:** *(hand on chest)* Your delivery is INSANE.

**KANT:** I'm working on it.

**DIOGENES:** *(laughing now)* Don't. Keep it exactly like that. Never change.

**CAROL:** *(shaking her head, smiling)* You're awful.

**KANT:** *(slight smile)* I know.

*They sit. Sunset. Something has started.*

**DIOGENES:** *(passing the apple)* You want some?

**KANT:** *(accepting)* Thank you.

*He takes a bite. They watch the sun go down.*

**CAROL:** *(after a beat)* Same time tomorrow?

**KANT:** *(no pause this time)* Yes.

---

## POST-CREDITS STING

*Office. Clinical. Quiet.*

*A file folder being opened.*

**UNKNOWN VOICE:** *(cold, professional)* Subject identified. Kant, Immanuel. Transfer from Königsberg.

*Page turning.*

**UNKNOWN VOICE:** Preliminary assessment: Category A. High coherence. Principle-stable.

*Beat.*

**UNKNOWN VOICE:** Tag him. Add to the active list.

*File closing.*

**UNKNOWN VOICE:** There are more of them.

---

## END OF PILOT

---

## APPENDIX: WHY THIS WORKS

### The Heart

The pilot isn't about philosophy—it's about belonging. Kant finds his people. The trolley problem is just the test that proves they're real to him. The joke at the end lands because he was willing to die (or refuse to kill) for people he met that day.

### The Believability

Teenagers don't explain themselves. They just ARE. Diogenes doesn't say "I'm a provocateur"—he bets on lacrosse guys crying. Carol doesn't say "I notice feelings"—she asks Kant what he's thinking. They're COOL because they've opted out, not because they're performing quirk.

### The Intelligence

The audience is trusted with the actual trolley problem argument. Both sides are argued well. Kant's position—the distinction between killing and letting die—is philosophically legitimate. We don't dumb it down.

### The Stakes

The joke at the end is devastating because it references something REAL that just happened. If you cut the trolley scene, the joke is mildly clever. With the scene, it's cathartic.

---

*"They're not studying philosophy. They ARE philosophy."*

**END OF DOCUMENT**
