---

## 1. Platform Trends: Where Tweens Consume Content

### The YouTube Dominance

YouTube remains the undisputed king of tween media consumption. According to [Pew Research (2024)](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/):
- **90% of teens** use YouTube
- **75% visit YouTube daily**
- Teen boys are more likely to use YouTube "almost constantly" (19% vs. 11% of girls)

### TikTok Despite Age Restrictions

[UC San Francisco research (2025)](https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2025/01/429296/many-children-use-tiktok-against-rules) found:
- **68.2% of children under 13** use TikTok despite platform age restrictions
- 60% of teens visit TikTok daily
- Teen girls use TikTok more than boys (66% vs. 59%)
- **6.3% have accounts hidden from parents**

### Streaming Fragmentation

From [CNBC (2025)](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/kids-content-streaming-companies-chase-profits.html):
- Families with children use **13.6 streaming services** on average (vs. 8.2 for childless households)
- Streaming accounts for **66% of total TV time** for 6-17 year olds during summer
- Disney+, Max, and YouTube are taking increasing share from traditional kids networks

### The Decline of Linear Kids TV

[MIPJunior 2024](https://air.io/en/on-air/what-this-means-for-kids-content-10-insights-from-mipjunior-2024) reports:
> "The kids' industry must radically re-think how it creates, produces and distributes content as US giants Nickelodeon, Disney and Cartoon Network have lost their audience to YouTube."

**Key Insight**: Traditional TV channels are no longer gatekeepers. YouTube is where tweens discover content, with streaming for deeper engagement.

## 2. Format Preferences: How Tweens Want Content Delivered

### The Short-Form Revolution

From [Common Sense Census (2025)](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/research/the-2025-common-sense-census-media-use-by-kids-zero-to-eight):
- Traditional TV viewing has **declined significantly**
- Short-form video platforms (TikTok, YouTube Shorts) are on the rise
- **Gaming time has surged 65%** in four years

### Bite-Sized But Substantial

Tweens want "bite-sized series" that deliver comprehensive content in "fast-paced but insightful episodes"—perfect for a tween with a thirst for knowledge but not hours to wade through the internet.

However, [UC Irvine's New University (2025)](https://newuniversity.org/2025/04/08/what-happened-to-tween-media/) warns:
> "Gone are the catchy musical numbers, compelling narratives and strong character development that defined the golden era of TV for tweens. Instead, there has been an influx of short-form content on TikTok, YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels which are heavily driven by goals of corporate profit rather than genuine storytelling."

### The Shorts-to-Long Pipeline

[MIPJunior 2024](https://air.io/en/on-air/what-this-means-for-kids-content-10-insights-from-mipjunior-2024):
> "Shorts and long-form content actually work together. Shorts act like trailers—quick, snackable teasers that get kids excited for the longer content."

### Episode Length Preferences

- **Short miniseries** (6 episodes, one season) work well for "holiday break or short vacation" viewing
- **11-22 minute episodes** remain standard for animated series
- **7-minute webisodes** gaining traction for mobile-first content

### Attention Span Concerns

[Research from 2024-2025](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12230358/) shows:
- Heavy short-form video use linked to **reduced inhibitory control and attention spans**
- "TikTok brain" manifests as "diminished patience for tasks that are longer and more complex"
- Children may struggle to focus on anything that doesn't offer instant stimulation

**Design Implication**: Content must hook quickly but can sustain depth. The entry point matters more than ever.

## 3. Successful Recent Shows: What's Working Now

### The Bluey Phenomenon

[Bluey became the most-watched show in America in 2024](https://theweek.com/culture-life/bluey-tv-show-parents-disney-plus-phenomenon)—not just children's programming, but ALL shows—with 55.62 billion minutes watched on Disney+.

## 4. Themes That Resonate

### Mental Health & Emotional Intelligence

[The JED Foundation (2025)](https://jedfoundation.org/what-to-expect-in-2025-new-years-trends-in-youth-mental-health/) reports:
- 45% of young people ages 10-24 struggled with mental health in past two years
- 29% had engaged in or considered self-harm
- LGBTQIA+ youth **3x more likely** to report poor mental health

Shows that model emotional regulation, resilience, and self-awareness (like Bluey) are meeting a genuine need.

### Identity & Self-Discovery

[MIPJunior 2024](https://www.mipblog.com/2024/09/whats-new-in-kids-content/) identifies "heritage and self-discovery" as one of three major programming trends.

From [the animation renaissance](https://xtramagazine.com/culture/cartoons-tv-queer-representation-177820):
- Steven Universe explored "grief, trauma, gender, consent, and what it really means to be oneself"
- She-Ra showed healing through admitting feelings, not violence
- Kipo emphasized finding common ground over physical victory

### Environmental Awareness

[MIPJunior 2024](https://www.mipblog.com/2024/09/whats-new-in-kids-content/):
> "Shows promoting environmental consciousness and social responsibility have seen growing popularity. Programs like Audrey's Shelter (France 4) and Vida the Vet (CBeebies) encourage young viewers to care for the environment."

[UNICEF's State of the World's Children 2024](https://www.unicef.org/reports/state-of-worlds-children/2024): Approximately 1 billion children live in countries facing high climate risk.

### Ethics Through Compassion (Not Rules)

[AV Club analysis](https://www.avclub.com/8-kids-cartoons-that-embrace-compassion-as-much-as-adv-1843066239):
> "In the current bumper crop of animated series, many standout programs promote compassion, acceptance, and individualism right alongside their interplanetary adventures and fantastical explorations."

The key insight from shows like [Steven Universe and She-Ra](https://collider.com/abolish-the-police-steven-universe-she-ra/):
> "Abolitionist ethics start with seeing the full humanity of wrongdoers, as opposed to reducing individuals to the worst decisions they have made."

Steven Universe's approach: Rather than punishing antagonists, the show "devotes nearly all energy towards beginning to heal those traumas."

### Complex Moral Frameworks

From [Kipo analysis](https://sfrareview.org/2022/04/22/review-of-kipo-and-the-age-of-wonderbeasts/):
> "The most remarkable aspect is the emphasis on peacemaking, which more often revolves around finding common ground and friendship among the various communities rather than achieving victory through physical violence."

## 5. What They're Tired Of

### Outdated Tropes

From [TV Tropes analysis](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AdultsAreUseless):

**"Adults Are Useless"**:
> "In shows that revolve around teenagers, preteens or younger children, adults can't do anything right... Teachers tend to be annoying sticks-in-the-mud. Parents are clueless, no longer care, or are either over- or under-protective."

This leads to the problematic message that "there's no point in telling adults about your problems because they'd either disbelieve you or be too useless to help."

**Bluey's success proves the opposite works**: Competent, involved parents who model good behavior are refreshing, not boring.

### The Content Gap

[UC Irvine (2025)](https://newuniversity.org/2025/04/08/what-happened-to-tween-media/):
> "The lack of quality media aimed towards tweens is alarming as it leaves them susceptible to harmful influences and content, which can negatively impact their self-esteem and mental development."

### What's Implicitly Rejected

Based on what succeeds, tweens are rejecting:
- **Patronizing simplification** (prefer Gravity Falls' intricate lore)
- **Moralizing without modeling** (prefer Bluey's "show don't tell")
- **Binary good/evil** (prefer Steven Universe's complexity)
- **Adults as obstacles** (prefer competent mentors)
- **Fast-paced visual chaos** (Bluey succeeds with "soft colors, natural dialogue, moderate pacing")
- **Heteronormative defaults** (embrace LGBTQ+ representation)

### Representation Fatigue Without Substance

From [Geena Davis Institute (2024)](https://geenadavisinstitute.org/research/see-jane-2024-how-has-on-screen-representation-in-childrens-television-changed-from-2018-to-2023/):
- Disability representation remains at only **0.9-1.1%** of characters
- LGBTQIA+ characters skew white and young
- Latinx, Native, and MENA representation significantly underrepresented

Kids notice performative diversity without authentic storytelling.

## 6. Interactive & Participatory Elements

### Beyond Passive Viewing

[Stornaway.io research](https://www.stornaway.io/interactive-video-kids-entertainment-examples/) notes the shift:
> "Viewers want to control how they consume content, whether it's a series or an ad. This reflects the digital-native generation's expectation to be in control of their viewing experience."

Children prefer video content on social media over traditional TV—and even prefer "short snippets or compilations of film or TV show clips to the whole program or film itself."

### Gaming Integration

From [Common Sense Census 2025](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2025-common-sense-census-web-2.pdf):
- Gaming time surged **65% in four years**
- 40% of children have a tablet by age 2
- Nearly 1 in 4 have a personal cellphone by age 8

Gaming content creators (FGTeeV, DanTDM, Aphmau) succeed through:
- Family-friendly content with comedic narration
- Supporting strategic thinking and collaboration
- Quick jokes with high energy

### Second Screen Behavior

Nearly half of teens say they are online "almost constantly"—up from 24% a decade ago ([Pew 2024](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2024/12/12/teens-social-media-and-technology-2024/)).

This means:
- Content competes with constant notifications
- Memes and clips spread show awareness
- Community forms around content (not just passive consumption)

### Six Key Motivations for Kids' Content Consumption

From [MIPJunior 2024](https://air.io/en/on-air/what-this-means-for-kids-content-10-insights-from-mipjunior-2024):
1. **Fun** - Joy and stress relief
2. **A Safe Space** - Comfort and routine
3. **Social Learning** - Staying connected with peers
4. **Curiosity** - Learning new things about topics like animals and science
5. **Identity building** - Exploring who they are
6. **Active participation** - Controlling their experience

## 7. Global Perspectives

### Korean Animation Rises

From [Vitrina AI (2025)](https://vitrina.ai/blog/top-best-animation-studios-and-companies-in-south-korea/):
> "The rise of South Korea as an animation hub reflects a perfect blend of skilled talent, innovative storytelling, and international collaborations, making it a go-to destination for producers, distributors, and content buyers."

- **Rich world-building** (anime, Hilda)
- **Visual distinctiveness** (Korean animation style)
- **Accessibility through streaming** (Netflix, Disney+ global distribution)

### European Co-Productions

From [MIPJunior 2024](https://www.mipjunior.com/):
- Public broadcasters in Europe "are the jewel in the crown" in children's commissioning
- Focus on heritage and self-discovery themes
- Environmental programming gaining traction (France 4, CBeebies)

## Key Insights for Ethics Show Development

### What 2024-2025 Teaches Us

1. **Platform Strategy**: YouTube for discovery, streaming for depth. Short clips build awareness; full episodes deliver substance.

2. **Format**: Hook fast (under 60 seconds for clips), but don't sacrifice depth. The 11-minute or 22-minute episode format still works when content earns attention.

3. **Tone**: Model, don't moralize. Bluey succeeds by *showing* good behavior, not lecturing about it.

4. **Complexity**: Tweens can handle nuance. Steven Universe's approach to antagonists (understanding trauma, not just punishing) resonates more than simple good/evil.

5. **Competent Adults**: Revolutionary concept—adults who are helpful, wise, and involved. Not obstacles or buffoons.

6. **Authentic Representation**: Diversity must be woven into story, not performative. Kids notice the difference.

7. **Emotional Intelligence**: Mental health themes are essential, not optional. This generation faces unprecedented challenges.

8. **Global Lens**: Anime and Korean content prove non-Western storytelling resonates. Universal themes transcend cultural specifics.

9. **Participation**: Passive viewing is declining. Content needs community, discussion, and extensions.

10. **The Content Gap**: Quality tween content is undersupplied. The opportunity is real.

### The Successful Formula

The shows that break through in 2024-2025 share:
- **Respect for intelligence** (complex lore, no dumbing down)
- **Emotional authenticity** (real feelings, real stakes)
- **Visual distinctiveness** (memorable aesthetic)
- **Compassion over combat** (ethics through relationship, not rules)
- **Inclusive by default** (representation feels natural)
- **Adults as allies** (competent, involved, modeling good behavior)
