# Ethical Frameworks for Children (Ages 9-12)

> *Making philosophy accessible without making it simplistic*

---

## Overview

This document explores major ethical frameworks and how they can be translated for 9-12 year olds - an age when children are cognitively ready for abstract moral reasoning but still learn best through story, character, and concrete examples.

**Key Insight**: Children at this age are typically at Kohlberg's transition from pre-conventional to conventional moral reasoning. They can understand rules beyond punishment/reward, grasp social contracts, and begin considering perspectives beyond their own.

---

## PART I: The Four Major Frameworks

### 1. Virtue Ethics (Character-Based)

> *"Who am I becoming?" rather than "What should I do?"*

**Origin**: Ancient Greece, primarily Aristotle (384-322 BCE)

**Core Idea**: Morality is about developing good character traits (virtues) through practice. A virtuous person naturally does the right thing because they *are* the right kind of person.

#### Child-Friendly Framing

**The Garden Metaphor**: Your character is like a garden. Virtues are plants you cultivate through daily practice. Vices are weeds. You become what you repeatedly do.

**Key Virtues for Children**:
| Virtue | Child-Friendly Name | What It Looks Like |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Courage | Bravery | Speaking up when something's wrong, even when scared |
| Temperance | Self-Control | Waiting your turn, not grabbing the last cookie |
| Justice | Fairness | Sharing equally, standing up for others |
| Prudence | Good Judgment | Thinking before acting, considering consequences |
| Compassion | Kindness | Noticing when others are struggling, helping |
| Honesty | Truthfulness | Telling the truth even when it's hard |
| Generosity | Giving Spirit | Sharing without expecting something back |

**The Aristotelian "Golden Mean"** (simplified): Too little courage is cowardice. Too much is recklessness. True courage is the balance. This applies to all virtues.

#### Story Beats

- **Origin Story**: A character lacks a virtue, sees its value in someone else, decides to cultivate it
- **Practice Arc**: The daily struggle of building virtue - failures, small wins, gradual growth
- **The Test**: A moment where the cultivated virtue is truly needed
- **The Reflection**: Understanding that virtue isn't about perfection but direction

#### Character Trait Example: The Courage Shield

From the [Jubilee Centre for Character and Virtues](https://www.jubileecentre.ac.uk/character-education-/jubilee-centre-for-character-and-virtues-activity-resources/), this activity helps children identify:
- What courage means to them
- Times they've shown courage
- Different types of courage (physical, moral, social)

#### Recommended Resources

- [The Story of Ferdinand](https://www.goodnet.org/articles/25-childrens-books-that-teach-kids-meaningful-values) by Munro Leaf - teaching courage to be different
- [Elmer](https://www.goodnet.org/articles/25-childrens-books-that-teach-kids-meaningful-values) by David McKee - self-acceptance as a virtue
- [Teaching Children Virtues Through Play](https://ptaourchildren.org/teaching-children-virtues-through-play/) - practical activities

---

### 2. Consequentialism (Outcome-Based)

> *"What matters is the result, not the intention."*

**Origin**: Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), John Stuart Mill (1806-1873)

**Core Idea**: The right action is the one that produces the best overall consequences. Utilitarianism (the most common form) seeks "the greatest good for the greatest number."

#### Child-Friendly Framing

**The Ripples Metaphor**: Every action is like throwing a stone in a pond. The ripples spread outward. Good actions create good ripples. We try to create as many good ripples as possible.

**Key Concepts for Children**:
- **Thinking Ahead**: What will happen because of my choice?
- **Counting Everyone**: My happiness isn't more important than yours
- **The Bigger Picture**: Sometimes small sacrifices create bigger benefits

#### The Trolley Problem (Age-Appropriate)

The classic trolley problem can be introduced to 9-12 year olds. Research shows this works well:

> *"A runaway trolley is heading toward five people. You can flip a switch to divert it to a side track where only one person stands. Do you flip the switch?"*

One parent's experience with 8 and 9 year olds:
> "Both first responded that they would not push [the man]. When asked if their answer would change if the man was a murderer, the 9 year old said she might change her mind. The 8 year old quickly said that she probably wouldn't because he is still a person."

**Purpose**: Not to find "the answer" but to explore *how we make hard choices*.

**Follow-up Questions**:
- Does it matter if you push someone vs. flip a switch?
- What if the one person is your friend?
- What if you don't know anyone involved?
- Is not choosing still a choice?

#### Story Beats

- **The Dilemma**: A character faces a choice where every option has costs
- **The Calculation**: Thinking through who benefits and who is harmed
- **The Unintended Consequence**: Sometimes what seems best creates unexpected harm
- **The Accountability**: Owning the results of your choice, even good intentions

#### Character Trait Example

A character who always thinks about outcomes might:
- Be the "planner" of the group
- Sometimes seem cold because they focus on results
- Learn that intentions and relationships also matter
- Struggle when math-like thinking doesn't capture the full picture

#### Classroom Adaptation

Replace trolley tracks with school scenarios:
- "One student disrupts the lesson at the consequence of 29 others wanting to learn - what should the teacher do?"
- "Both friends want the same solo in the play - choosing one means disappointing the other"

---

### 3. Deontology (Rule-Based)

> *"Some things are simply right or wrong, regardless of outcomes."*

**Origin**: Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)

**Core Idea**: Morality is about following moral rules or duties. Some actions (lying, stealing, breaking promises) are inherently wrong, even if they produce good outcomes.

#### Child-Friendly Framing

**The Promises Metaphor**: Imagine if no one kept their promises. Society would fall apart. Keeping your word isn't just nice - it's the foundation of trust.

**Kant's Test** (simplified): "Before you act, imagine everyone in the world did the same thing. Would that work?"
- Lying? If everyone lied, no one could trust anyone.
- Stealing? If everyone stole, there'd be no property.
- Keeping promises? If everyone kept promises, trust grows.

**Key Concepts for Children**:
- **Rules Exist for Reasons**: Even when breaking them seems helpful, there's usually a deeper cost
- **Everyone Deserves Respect**: You can't use people as tools for your goals
- **Consistency Matters**: If it's wrong when others do it, it's wrong when you do it

#### The Tension with Outcomes

This is where ethics gets interesting for kids:

> *"Your friend asks if their drawing is good. You think it's not. Utilitarianism might say lie to spare their feelings. Deontology says never lie. What do you do?"*

**The Synthesis**: Maybe honesty and kindness aren't opposites. "I love that you're drawing! Here's one thing that might make it even better..."

#### Story Beats

- **The Hard Rule**: A character faces temptation to break a rule for a "good reason"
- **The Slippery Slope**: Once rules become bendable, where does it stop?
- **The Moral Stand**: Refusing to do wrong even when it costs something
- **The Trusted One**: Because they keep promises, people rely on them

#### Character Trait Example

A deontological character might:
- Be seen as "stubborn" or "inflexible"
- Be the one everyone trusts with secrets
- Struggle when two rules conflict (don't lie vs. don't hurt feelings)
- Learn that following the spirit of rules matters as much as the letter

#### Classroom Dilemma

> *"You see a friend cheating on a test. Telling the teacher might hurt your friend. Staying silent lets unfairness continue. The rule says 'don't cheat' - but you're not the one cheating. What's your duty?"*

---

### 4. Care Ethics (Relationship-Based)

> *"Morality happens in relationships, not abstract rules."*

**Origin**: Carol Gilligan (1982), Nel Noddings (1984)

**Core Idea**: Moral decisions happen in the context of relationships. Rather than abstract principles, we should ask: What does caring require in this specific situation with these specific people?

#### Child-Friendly Framing

**The Web Metaphor**: We're all connected in a web of relationships - family, friends, community. When we care well for our connections, the whole web is stronger.

**Key Concepts for Children**:
- **Paying Attention**: Really noticing how others feel and what they need
- **Responding**: Taking action because you care, not because of rules
- **Relationships Are Work**: Care requires ongoing attention, not just one-time actions
- **Everyone Needs Care**: Including yourself - you can't pour from an empty cup

#### Gilligan's Different Voice

Carol Gilligan challenged Kohlberg's male-centric moral development model. Her research found girls often reason morally through relationships and responsibility rather than abstract rules.

**Both Approaches Are Valid**:
- Justice orientation: "What's fair? What are the rules?"
- Care orientation: "What does this relationship need? How can I help?"

The best moral reasoning integrates both.

#### Story Beats

- **The Notice**: A character pays attention and sees what others miss
- **The Attunement**: Understanding what someone needs (not what you'd want)
- **The Sacrifice**: Caring sometimes costs something personal
- **The Reciprocity**: Being cared for and learning to receive care

#### Character Trait Example

A care-oriented character might:
- Be the "heart" of the group - noticing emotions, mediating conflicts
- Sometimes struggle with boundaries (caring for everyone but themselves)
- Excel at understanding why people do what they do
- Learn that caring doesn't mean fixing everyone's problems

#### Nel Noddings' Four Elements

From [Nel Noddings' work](https://infed.org/dir/welcome/nel-noddings-the-ethics-of-care-and-education/) on care in education:

1. **Modeling**: Adults demonstrate caring relationships
2. **Dialogue**: Genuine conversation about caring and being cared for
3. **Practice**: Opportunities to care for others
4. **Confirmation**: Affirming the caring impulses in children

---

## PART II: Philosophy for Children (P4C)

### The Movement

Philosophy for Children was founded by [Matthew Lipman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_for_Children) in the late 1960s at Columbia University. He observed that college students lacked critical thinking skills and believed the solution was starting philosophy education much earlier.

**Core Insight**: Contrary to Piaget's claim that children can't think abstractly until age 11-12, children are natural philosophers when given the right tools.

### The Method: Community of Inquiry

P4C centers on the "Community of Inquiry" - a classroom practice where:
1. Students read a philosophical stimulus (story, question, image)
2. They generate questions about what puzzles them
3. They select a question to explore together
4. The teacher facilitates discussion without providing answers
5. The group reasons together, building on each other's ideas

**The 4 C's of P4C**:
- **Critical** thinking (logic, evidence)
- **Creative** thinking (imagination, alternatives)
- **Caring** thinking (empathy, ethics)
- **Collaborative** thinking (building on others' ideas)

### Key Texts

#### Harry Stottlemeier's Discovery (1969)

Lipman's first novel, for ages 11-14. [The story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Stottlemeier's_Discovery) follows a classroom of children who discover logical reasoning after Harry makes a mistake about comets and planets.

**Philosophical Themes**: Logic, authority, morality, religion, justice, truth, knowledge, beauty, goodness

**Why It Works**: Philosophy emerges from everyday classroom situations. Characters think through problems together. No adult provides "the answer."

**Global Reach**: Taught in 5,000+ US schools, translated into 18 languages.

#### Lisa (1976)

For ages 12-14, [*Lisa*](https://digitalcommons.montclair.edu/iapc_middle_schl_curriculum/7/) focuses specifically on ethical reasoning. Lisa and her classmates encounter issues including animal rights, sexism, racism, justice, divorce, and death.

**Ethical Concepts Explored**: The right, the fair, the good, perfection, naturalism

**Accompanying Manual**: *Ethical Inquiry* provides tools for deliberation: anticipating consequences, considering circumstances, giving reasons, universalizing, being consistent, projecting ideals.

## PART III: Age-Appropriate Moral Dilemmas

### What Makes a Good Dilemma

From [Character.org](https://character.org/ethical-dilemmas/) and [Edutopia](https://www.edutopia.org/article/benefits-teaching-ethical-dilemmas/):

1. **No clear right answer** - genuinely difficult trade-offs
2. **Relatable stakes** - situations children encounter or can imagine
3. **Multiple perspectives** - reasonable people can disagree
4. **Values in tension** - loyalty vs. honesty, fairness vs. kindness

### Dilemmas That Work (Ages 9-12)

#### The Tattle Tale
> *Your friend is cheating on homework. If you tell the teacher, your friend gets in trouble. If you don't, it's unfair to kids who did the work honestly. What do you do?*

**Frameworks in Play**:
- Deontology: Cheating is wrong; honesty requires speaking up
- Care Ethics: What does my friendship require?
- Consequentialism: What happens to trust in either case?

#### The Found Money
> *You find $20 on the playground. No one sees you find it. You have no idea whose it is. What do you do?*

**Follow-ups**:
- What if it was $1? $100?
- What if you saw who dropped it but they're already gone?
- What if you really needed the money?

#### The Exclusive Party
> *Your friend is planning a party but can only invite 5 people. They want you to help choose. Another friend - one who's been left out before - really wants to come, but isn't in the "group." What do you advise?*

**Frameworks in Play**:
- Virtue Ethics: What does kindness require?
- Consequentialism: Whose feelings matter more?
- Care Ethics: What does each relationship need?

#### The Broken Vase
> *You accidentally break your mom's favorite vase while playing ball inside (which you weren't supposed to do). No one saw. Your younger sibling might get blamed. What do you do?*

**The Layers**:
- Personal cost of confession
- Harm to innocent sibling
- Trust with parent
- Living with knowing

#### The Struggling Friend
> *A classmate asks to copy your homework. They're really struggling and might fail. You know copying is wrong, but you also see them crying from stress. What do you do?*

**Beyond Binary Thinking**:
- Help them understand the work instead?
- Talk to the teacher about their struggles?
- What does real friendship look like here?

## PART IV: Cultural Considerations

### The Universal vs. Particular Problem

Research shows both [universal patterns and cultural variation](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.764360/full) in moral reasoning:

**Universal Elements**:
- Care for kin and vulnerable
- Reciprocity and fairness (within group)
- Avoidance of harm
- Honoring commitments

**Culturally Varying Elements**:
- Individual vs. collective priority
- What counts as "harm"
- Authority structures
- Expression of moral judgments

### Shweder's Three Ethics

Richard Shweder's cross-cultural research identified [three moral codes](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8710723/):

| Ethic | Core Concern | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **Autonomy** | Individual rights, liberty | Western liberal democracies |
| **Community** | Group harmony, roles, duties | Confucian societies |
| **Divinity** | Spiritual purity, sacred order | Traditional religious communities |

**Implication for Children's Show**: A character might prioritize family honor (Community) while another prioritizes personal expression (Autonomy). Neither is wrong - they're operating from different ethical foundations.

### The Golden Rule: A Cross-Cultural Bridge

[The Golden Rule appears across virtually all cultures and religions](https://kidworldcitizen.org/world-religions-golden-rule-across-cultures/):

| Tradition | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| Christianity | "Do unto others as you would have them do unto you" |
| Judaism | "What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor" |
| Islam | "None of you truly believes until he wishes for his brother what he wishes for himself" |
| Buddhism | "Treat not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful" |
| Confucianism | "Do not do to others what you would not want done to yourself" |
| Hinduism | "This is the sum of duty: do not do to others what would cause pain if done to you" |

**However**: [Research shows declining usage](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_dont_most_parents_teach_the_golden_rule) - less than 14% of American parents use the phrase with children, and 28% are unfamiliar with its meaning.

### Navigating Cultural Sensitivity

For a children's show addressing ethics globally:

**Do**:
- Present multiple valid perspectives on moral questions
- Show characters respectfully navigating different value systems
- Use the Golden Rule as common ground
- Acknowledge that "right answers" can look different in different contexts

**Don't**:
- Present one culture's framework as universally correct
- Stereotype cultures as monolithic
- Avoid hard questions in the name of sensitivity
- Ignore genuine moral disagreements

### Kohlberg's Model: A Critique to Know

Kohlberg's influential [stages of moral development](https://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html) were developed studying primarily white Western males. Carol Gilligan and others [critiqued this universalism](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carol-Gilligan), showing that care-based reasoning (more common in girls and collectivist cultures) was being undervalued.

**For Content Creators**: Avoid framing progression as "pre-conventional → conventional → post-conventional" as if there's one ladder. Multiple valid paths exist.

## PART V: From Framework to Story

### How Each Framework Becomes Character

| Framework | Character Type | Strength | Growth Edge |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-------------|
| Virtue Ethics | The Cultivator | Integrity, consistency | May judge others harshly |
| Consequentialism | The Calculator | Big-picture thinking | May justify harmful means |
| Deontology | The Keeper | Reliability, trust | May be inflexible |
| Care Ethics | The Connector | Empathy, attunement | May neglect self-care |

### The Ideal Ensemble

A balanced cast models that each approach has value:

- **The Idealist** (Virtue): Inspired by who they want to become
- **The Pragmatist** (Consequentialism): Focused on what actually works
- **The Principled** (Deontology): Holds the line when others waver
- **The Heart** (Care): Sees the person, not just the problem

**The Learning**: Each character learns from the others. The most ethical choice often integrates multiple frameworks.

### Story Structure: The Ethical Arc

**Act 1 - The Situation**: Present a dilemma without obvious solution

**Act 2 - The Perspectives**: Each character applies their framework
- Character A: "What kind of person do I want to be?"
- Character B: "What creates the best outcome?"
- Character C: "What's the right rule here?"
- Character D: "What does this relationship need?"

**Act 3 - The Synthesis**: The resolution honors multiple truths
- Not "Character A was right all along"
- But "Each perspective contributed something essential"

**Coda - The Reflection**: Characters articulate what they learned from each other

### Avoiding Moralizing

From [The Role of Moral Lessons in Children's Books](https://spines.com/the-role-of-moral-lessons-in-childrens-books/):

**The Problem**: Heavy-handed moral lessons alienate young audiences and reduce complex ethics to simplistic formulas.

**The Solution**:
- Let characters struggle authentically
- Don't always resolve neatly
- Trust young viewers to draw conclusions
- Show consequences naturally, don't lecture about them
- Sometimes good people make mistakes; sometimes doing right is hard

**The Matthew Lipman Approach**: The story is "non-authoritarian, anti-indoctrinating, respects inquiry and reasoning, encourages alternative modes of thought, and suggests how children can learn from one another."

## PART VI: Picture Books as Entry Points

### Recommended Titles by Framework

#### Virtue Ethics
- *The Three Questions* by Jon Muth - Tolstoy's questions about what matters most
- *Each Kindness* by Jacqueline Woodson - the weight of unkindness
- *The Story of Ferdinand* by Munro Leaf - courage to be oneself

#### Consequentialism
- *Hey Little Ant* by Phillip Hoose - considering impact on others (the ant's perspective)
- *Four Feet, Two Sandals* by Karen Williams - sharing creates more than keeping

#### Deontology
- *Sam and the Lucky Money* by Karen Chinn - what do promises and gifts mean?
- *A Day's Work* by Eve Bunting - honesty even when it costs

#### Care Ethics
- *Good People Everywhere* by Lynea Gillen - recognizing caring in the world
- *Sylvester and the Magic Pebble* by William Steig - gratitude for relationships

### The Prindle Institute Approach

[Teaching Children Philosophy](https://www.prindleinstitute.org/teaching-children-philosophy/) offers 200+ guides that transform picture books into philosophical inquiry. Key method:

1. Read the book together
2. Generate questions about what puzzled you
3. Vote on which question to explore
4. Discuss in a community of inquiry
5. No one (including the teacher) has "the answer"

---

## Summary: Frameworks at a Glance

| Framework | Core Question | Metaphor | Hero | Shadow |
|-----------|---------------|----------|------|--------|
| Virtue Ethics | Who am I becoming? | Garden | The cultivator of character | The self-righteous judge |
| Consequentialism | What outcomes result? | Ripples | The strategist for good | The ends-justify-means actor |
| Deontology | What is the rule? | Foundation | The trustworthy promise-keeper | The inflexible rule-follower |
| Care Ethics | What does love require? | Web | The attentive friend | The boundary-less caretaker |

**The Meta-Lesson**: These aren't competing truths but complementary lenses. The wisest moral actors draw from all four, knowing when each is most needed.
