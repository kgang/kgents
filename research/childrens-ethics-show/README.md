# Little Kant: Research Foundation

> *"The first university-level introduction to morals for 9-12 year olds."*

**Research Date**: January 2026
**Target Audience**: Tweens (ages 9-12)
**Constitutional Grounding**: kgents Constitution (seven principles, seven articles)

---

## The Vision

**Little Kant** features real philosophers—Kant, Diogenes, Pascal, Aristotle, and others—as eccentric, struggling characters who LIVE their philosophies rather than lecture about them. Children meet these thinkers not as statues but as humans wrestling with questions that still have no final answers.

The show gives children "their first university-level introduction on morals"—not through academic language, but by trusting children to engage with genuine ideas when presented through embodied drama.

## Document Map

### Foundation Research (General Principles)

| Document | Purpose | Key Finding |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **01-existing-shows-analysis.md** | What works in ethics-focused children's media | Non-linear moral growth + sympathetic antagonists = breakthrough |
| **02-developmental-psychology.md** | 9-12 cognitive/emotional capabilities | "Kids already have moral intuitions—they need a toolkit, not lectures" |
| **03-ethical-frameworks.md** | Philosophical traditions made accessible | Four frameworks (virtue, consequence, duty, care) can be embodied as character types |
| **04-storytelling-techniques.md** | Narrative craft for moral education | The Zuko Principle: earned redemption through natural consequences |
| **05-constitution-mapping.md** | kgents principles → children's content | All 7 principles + 7 articles translate to design constraints |
| **06-current-trends.md** | 2024-2025 media landscape | Quality tween content is dramatically undersupplied |

## The Six Pillars (from Media Analysis)

Each source contributes a distinct, irreplaceable principle:

1. **THRESHOLD TRANSFORMATION** (Spirited Away): Create liminal space where identities dissolve and reform
2. **THE DEFENDED NEW** (Ratatouille): Protect children's nascent philosophical capacity from gatekeeping
3. **EARNED WEIRDNESS** (Adventure Time): Absurdity creates permission for sincerity and depth
4. **RESEARCH-GROUNDED ITERATION** (Sesame Street): Test with actual children; intuition guides, research validates
5. **EMOTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE** (Mr. Rogers): Safety precedes all other learning; pacing is pedagogy
6. **DEVELOPMENTAL BRIDGING** (Dragon Tales): Scaffolding works; the principles scale, only complexity changes

## The Formula

```
LITTLE KANT =
  Container (threshold world with entry/exit rituals)
  + Embodied Philosophers (weird, struggling, disagreeing)
  + Child Protagonists (asking, not answering)
  + Research Foundation (CTW-level iteration with P4C scholarship)
  + Emotional Infrastructure (Mr. Rogers-level safety)
  + Earned Depth (Adventure Time-level patience)
  + Visual Philosophy (Miyazaki-level trust in image)
  + Defended Curiosity (Ratatouille-level protection of the new)
  + Developmental Bridge (Dragon Tales-level scaffolding)
```

## Constitutional Grounding

The kgents Constitution provides structural constraints:

**Seven Principles** (design constraints):
- TASTEFUL: Episodes earn every minute. No filler.
- CURATED: Limited philosopher ensemble. Deep, not wide.
- ETHICAL: Characters own their decisions. Transparency honored.
- JOY-INDUCING: Philosophy as delight, not medicine.
- COMPOSABLE: Philosophers can combine perspectives. Synthesis is possible.
- HETERARCHICAL: No philosopher is always right. Wisdom rotates by context.
- GENERATIVE: Understanding principles enables improvisation.

**Seven Articles** (relationship rules):
- Symmetric Agency: Ideas judged on merit, not authority
- Adversarial Cooperation: Philosophers challenge ideas, not each other
- Supersession Rights: Old ideas can be replaced through proof
- The Disgust Veto: Gut reactions are valid data
- Trust Accumulation: Characters earn credibility over time
- Fusion as Goal: The Third Answer neither side could find alone
- Amendment: Even philosophical positions can evolve

---

## What Was Removed

This research deliberately excludes:
- Specific character names/personalities (beyond real philosophers)
- Specific episode plots or scripts
- Specific dialogue or scenes
- Specific setting details
- Any pre-determined narrative structure

The framework is **generative**—it provides constraints that enable creative work rather than prescribing specific content.

## Success Criteria

If Little Kant succeeds, children will:
1. **Recognize real philosophers** as people who lived and thought
2. **Have language for ethical approaches** ("What would Kant say?")
3. **Ask better questions before acting**
4. **See synthesis as superior to winning**
5. **Feel philosophy is theirs**—already begun, not intimidating
