## TIER 1: PILOT SEASON CANDIDATES (High Resonance)

These dilemmas passed the Mirror Test for compelling dramatic potential and genuine philosophical depth.

### D-001: The Copied Homework
**Tension**: Loyalty vs. Fairness
**Situation**: Your best friend copied your homework without asking. The teacher notices your answers are identical and asks you directly: "Did Marcus copy your work?"
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "Could everyone lie in this situation? If so, trust collapses. Tell the truth."
- **Gilligan**: "What does your relationship with Marcus need right now? Truth that repairs, not destroys."
- **Diogenes**: "Why is homework even the measure of learning? Question the whole game."
**Why It Works**: Every child has faced loyalty vs. honesty. No easy answer. Real stakes.

### D-002: The Lunch Table Exile
**Tension**: Inclusion vs. Group Harmony
**Situation**: Your friend group quietly decided to stop sitting with Jordan because "they're weird." You like Jordan. The group expects you to comply.
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Aristotle**: "What kind of friend are you becoming? Virtue is practiced, not proclaimed."
- **Kant**: "Treat Jordan as an end, not a means to your social comfort."
- **Diogenes**: "Who decided 'weird' is bad? Sit wherever you want. Bark at the table if needed."
**Why It Works**: Social exclusion is visceral for tweens. The "we don't need a reason" cruelty is real.

### D-003: The Found Money
**Tension**: Self-Interest vs. Unknown Obligation
**Situation**: You find $20 on the playground. No one saw you pick it up. You could really use it for the game you've been saving for.
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "Imagine everyone kept found money. Could that be a universal law?"
- **Pascal**: "What's the probability someone desperately needs this $20 vs. your want?"
- **Aristotle**: "The virtuous person considers not what they can do, but what they should do."
**Why It Works**: Tests pure self-interest vs. abstract obligation. No one's watching.

### D-004: The Talent Show Sabotage
**Tension**: Competition vs. Integrity
**Situation**: You discover your rival's talent show act uses music they didn't get permission to use. Reporting it means they're disqualified. You'd probably win.
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "Are you reporting because it's wrong, or because you benefit? Motive matters."
- **Aristotle**: "A victory obtained through another's failure is hollow. What excellence is that?"
- **Diogenes**: "Talent shows are absurd status games. Walk away from the whole thing."
**Why It Works**: Exposes how easily "doing the right thing" becomes cover for self-interest.

### D-005: The Grandfather's Lie
**Tension**: Kindness vs. Truth
**Situation**: Your grandfather is dying and asks if you'll keep running the family farm. You hate farming and plan to leave. He'll never know.
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "A lie is a lie, even a kind one. Treat him as someone who deserves truth."
- **Gilligan**: "What does love require here? What will he carry into death?"
- **Pascal**: "What's the cost of this small lie? What's the cost of this hard truth?"
**Why It Works**: Death makes everything heavier. The "he'll never know" adds complexity.

### D-006: The Anonymous Bully
**Tension**: Justice vs. Mercy
**Situation**: You discover who's been anonymously cyberbullying your classmate. It's someone going through a terrible time at home. Exposing them would help the victim but destroy the bully.
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "Actions have consequences regardless of context. The victim deserves justice."
- **Gilligan**: "Both are suffering. What response addresses both?"
- **Aristotle**: "Mercy is a virtue, but so is justice. The mean isn't obvious."
**Why It Works**: Complicates "bully = bad" with genuine complexity.

### D-007: The Climate Lie
**Tension**: Effectiveness vs. Honesty
**Situation**: Your environmental club is presenting statistics. A small exaggeration would make your case much more compelling. "It's for a good cause."
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "If environmental advocates lie, why should anyone trust them? The cause is undermined."
- **Pascal**: "What's the expected value of this lie vs. the risk of discovery?"
- **Diogenes**: "You want to save the planet but you can't tell the truth? Start there."
**Why It Works**: "Lying for good" is everywhere. Tests ends-justify-means thinking.

### D-008: The Exclusionary Birthday
**Tension**: Personal Freedom vs. Others' Feelings
**Situation**: You can only invite 10 people to your birthday. Inviting David means leaving out Emma, who will be devastated. David is your closer friend.
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Gilligan**: "How do you hold both relationships? What does Emma need to hear?"
- **Kant**: "You're not obligated to invite everyone. But how you communicate matters."
- **Aristotle**: "A good friend navigates hard choices with care, not avoidance."
**Why It Works**: Limited resources + feelings = universal tween experience.

### D-009: The Protest Arrest
**Tension**: Law vs. Conscience
**Situation**: Your older sibling got arrested at a protest for a cause you believe in. Your parents are furious. You're asked to condemn their actions.
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "Is the law always right? What's your duty when conscience and law conflict?"
- **Diogenes**: "Laws are conventions, not truths. Your sibling followed a higher law."
- **Aristotle**: "Civic virtue matters. So does family loyalty. Both can be right."
**Why It Works**: Authority (parents, law) vs. conscience. Family pressure makes it visceral.

### D-010: The AI Art Credit
**Tension**: Authorship vs. Honesty
**Situation**: You used AI to help create an art project. It looks amazing. The teacher asks: "Did you make this?" What counts as "you" making something?
**Philosopher Positions**:
- **Kant**: "What is the truth of authorship here? Can you universalize 'AI counts as me'?"
- **Aristotle**: "What skill did you develop? Is the virtue in the product or the process?"
- **Diogenes**: "Everyone uses tools. A hammer doesn't get credit. Neither should the AI."
**Why It Works**: Contemporary, genuinely contested, no clear answer.

## TIER 2: STRONG CANDIDATES (Season 1)

### D-011: The Sick Day Lie
You're not really sick, but you desperately need a mental health day. Lying to your parents means rest. Telling the truth means explaining feelings you can't articulate.

### D-012: The Regifted Present
You accidentally discover that the "thoughtful" gift from your friend was actually regifted from someone else. Do you say something?

### D-013: The Whispered Slur
You hear a classmate whisper a slur about another student. They don't know you heard. The target doesn't know it happened.

### D-014: The Cheating Parent
You discover your parent is cheating on your other parent. They don't know you know.

### D-015: The Animal Rescue
You find a stray dog. Your family can't keep it, but the shelter might euthanize it. A friend offers to take it, but they're not responsible pet owners.

### D-016: The Lab Partner Load
Your lab partner did almost no work but expects equal credit. Reporting them hurts their grade. Saying nothing hurts your sense of fairness.

### D-017: The Secret Eating Disorder
You notice a friend is showing signs of an eating disorder. They explicitly asked you not to tell anyone.

### D-018: The Inherited Bias
Your beloved grandparent says something casually racist. Do you challenge them? How?

### D-019: The Competitive Friend
Your best friend only seems happy when they're better than you at something. Their friendship feels conditional.

### D-020: The Stolen Confession
Someone confides that they stole something small. You're now complicit in knowing.
