# Little Kant: Episode 1 Treatment

## "THE QUESTION CAFE"

> *Pilot Episode | 22 minutes | Series Premiere*

---

## SERIES FRAME: THE THRESHOLD

**The Concept**: Little Kant takes place in "The Question Cafe"—a liminal space that exists between heartbeats, between decisions, in the pause before you act. When a child faces a genuine ethical dilemma, they can find themselves here.

The cafe appears differently to different people but always contains:
- A bar/counter with drinks that taste like feelings
- Tables where conversations never end, only pause
- A wall of unanswered questions (physical, written, growing)
- Windows that show possible futures
- Philosophers who have been here since their ideas were born

**How Entry Works**: A child doesn't choose to come to the Question Cafe. They find themselves here when a decision matters enough. They return to their world at the same moment they left—but changed.

**Design Principle**: The cafe is cozy, strange, and safe. It feels like a place you've been before in a dream. Ma (pregnant pause) is possible here. Time works differently. The philosophers are eccentric tenants, not instructors.

## EPISODE 1: "THE QUESTION CAFE"

### COLD OPEN (1 minute)

**INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY**

MAYA (11, curious, carries too many books) walks quickly, late for class. She passes her friend JORDAN who's being verbally cornered by DEREK and his friends.

DEREK: (mocking) "Why do you even sit with us, Jordan? Nobody asked you to."

Jordan's eyes meet Maya's. A silent plea.

Maya hesitates. She's already late. Mr. Patterson will give her a demerit. Jordan's not being physically hurt. If she intervenes, Derek's group will target her too.

**MAYA'S INNER VOICE**: *Just walk. You can text Jordan later. You're late. It's not that serious.*

Maya takes a step to leave—

—and the hallway light shifts. The sounds muffle. Maya blinks.

She's somewhere else.

**CUT TO TITLE: LITTLE KANT**

### ACT ONE: THE THRESHOLD (5 minutes)

**INT. THE QUESTION CAFE - CONTINUOUS**

Maya stands in an impossible space. A cafe that feels like someone's living room, library, and sacred space combined. Late afternoon light through windows that show... nothing. Or everything.

At the counter, a wild-looking man is arguing with the espresso machine.

**DIOGENES**: (to machine) You're a liar. You promise coffee. You deliver brown water. (notices Maya) AH! Another one who couldn't just WALK PAST.

**MAYA**: What— where am I?

**DIOGENES**: Where thinking happens before acting. Also where the coffee is terrible. (extends hand) Diogenes. I lived in a barrel by choice.

A precise man in old-fashioned dress approaches, carrying a small clock.

**KANT**: You're making things worse, Diogenes. The child is disoriented. (to Maya, gently) You're in the Question Cafe. It exists in the pause before a choice. You're here because a decision matters to you.

**MAYA**: The decision to... help my friend?

**KANT**: (precise) Is that how you'd frame it? Interesting.

From a corner table, ARISTOTLE looks up from notes.

**ARISTOTLE**: She's not sure it is her friend. That's part of it. (to Maya) Come, sit. The drinks here taste like feelings, but they're safe.

Maya, uncertain, sits at Aristotle's table. Others are visible in the cafe—figures at other tables, conversations in progress, but blurred. She can't quite make them out.

**MAYA**: I don't understand. I was in school—

**ARISTOTLE**: And you still are. Time works differently here. You'll return at the same moment. With something.

**MAYA**: With what?

**GILLIGAN** appears, setting down a cup of something warm that smells like comfort.

**GILLIGAN**: That's what we figure out. You came here with a question. What is it?

Maya looks at the cup. Takes it. Sips. It tastes like... safety. She relaxes.

**MAYA**: Is it... is it wrong to walk past someone who needs help?

The philosophers exchange glances. This is what they're here for.

**DIOGENES**: FINALLY. A real question. Let's destroy some illusions.

### ACT TWO: THE POSITIONS (8 minutes)

#### Scene: The First Clash

**KANT**: (immediately) Could everyone walk past suffering? If so, no one would ever help anyone. The rule collapses. Therefore—

**DIOGENES**: (interrupting) Therefore nothing. Rules don't make you good. (to Maya) Would you have stopped to help a stranger? Be honest.

**MAYA**: ...Probably not. Jordan's my friend.

**DIOGENES**: So it's not about helping. It's about YOUR friend. That's at least honest.

**MAYA**: (defensive) That's not—

**GILLIGAN**: (gentle but firm) It's worth noticing. Why does it feel different because Jordan's your friend?

Maya thinks. The cafe seems to shift subtly around her—as if her thinking changes the space.

**MAYA**: Because... we have history? Because I know how they'll feel?

**ARISTOTLE**: (nodding) Friendship is serious. Aristotle takes it very seriously. (slight smile) I wrote several books about it.

**KANT**: But what if it was a stranger? Does the stranger not deserve help?

#### Scene: The Wall of Questions

Maya notices the wall behind the counter is covered in paper, chalk, etched words. Questions. Thousands of them. Old ones faded, new ones bright.

**MAYA**: What is that?

**DIOGENES**: Every question that mattered. Yours will go there too.

Maya reads a few:
- "Is a kind lie better than a cruel truth?"
- "What do I owe my brother?"
- "Can I be good if no one sees?"

**MAYA**: People have been asking these... forever?

**GILLIGAN**: We have. You will. That's not sad. It means you're not alone in asking.

#### Scene: Windows of Possibility

PASCAL appears from a corner, looking slightly feverish, excited.

**PASCAL**: But have you considered the OUTCOMES? Come, look.

He leads Maya to one of the strange windows. Through it, she sees—

**WINDOW 1**: Maya walking past Jordan. Jordan later, alone, crying. Jordan the next week, eating lunch alone. Jordan months later, withdrawn.

**PASCAL**: One possibility. What probability do you assign to this future if you walk past?

**MAYA**: I don't— I can't calculate that.

**PASCAL**: You must. Every choice is a wager against the future.

**WINDOW 2**: Maya intervening. Derek turning on her. Maya now a target. But also: Jordan's grateful smile. A bond strengthened. Derek's group, having overplayed their hand, losing status.

**PASCAL**: Another possibility. Costs. Benefits. Probabilities. This is how we decide.

**KANT**: (firmly) No. This is not how we decide. Outcomes are unpredictable. You cannot calculate morality.

**PASCAL**: Then how do you choose in uncertainty?

**KANT**: By asking what the right thing IS, regardless of what happens.

#### Scene: The Diogenes Challenge

Diogenes, who has been watching, suddenly stands on a table.

**DIOGENES**: All of you are missing the OBVIOUS. (to Maya) Why is Derek being a little tyrant?

**MAYA**: Because he's mean?

**DIOGENES**: Boring answer. Wrong answer. Derek is being a tyrant because everyone lets him. Including you. The question isn't whether to help Jordan. It's why you're all so afraid of a child with too much hair gel.

**ARISTOTLE**: That's... actually a good point.

**DIOGENES**: OF COURSE IT IS. (jumps down) The system is broken. You're not choosing between helping and not helping. You're choosing between participating in Derek's little kingdom and refusing.

**MAYA**: But if I refuse, I become a target.

**DIOGENES**: AND? (barks a laugh) I told the most powerful man in the world to get out of my sunlight. What's a fifth-grader with a bad attitude?

---

### ACT THREE: THE SYNTHESIS (6 minutes)

#### Scene: Maya's Realization

Maya sits alone at a table. The philosophers are nearby but giving her space. She's thinking.

**GILLIGAN**: (approaching) You look like you're carrying something.

**MAYA**: They're all right. And they're all wrong.

**GILLIGAN**: That's usually how it goes.

**MAYA**: Kant says I have to help because it's the rule. Pascal says I should calculate consequences. Diogenes says the whole game is stupid. Aristotle says it's about who I'm becoming. But they're all... talking about me.

**GILLIGAN**: Who's left out?

**MAYA**: (realizing) Jordan. What does Jordan need? Not as a... a philosophical puzzle. As my friend.

Gilligan smiles. The cafe seems to warm slightly.

#### Scene: The Question Crystallizes

Maya walks to the Wall of Questions. She picks up chalk.

**MAYA**: My question isn't whether to help. It's... (writing) "What does my friend need from me right now?"

She steps back. The question glows for a moment, then settles into the wall like it's always been there.

**KANT**: (quietly approving) A good question.

**ARISTOTLE**: The right question often matters more than any answer.

**MAYA**: But I still don't know what to DO.

**DIOGENES**: (surprisingly gentle) You do. You just don't want to admit it costs something.

Maya looks at him. He's right.

**MAYA**: If I help Jordan... I might lose things.

**DIOGENES**: And?

**MAYA**: And... I don't want to be someone who walks past.

#### Scene: The Return

The cafe begins to shift. The light changes. Maya feels herself pulled back toward—

**ARISTOTLE**: (quickly) You won't remember us clearly. It'll feel like... a thought you had. An instinct.

**GILLIGAN**: But we're here. Whenever the question matters enough.

**KANT**: Act as though you could will your action to become universal law.

**DIOGENES**: Or just don't be a coward. Simpler.

Maya laughs, despite herself. The cafe folds away—

### ACT FOUR: THE CHOICE (2 minutes)

**INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME MOMENT**

Maya is back. Jordan's eyes are still meeting hers. No time has passed.

But Maya is different.

**MAYA**: (walking toward the group) Hey Derek.

DEREK looks up, surprised.

**DEREK**: Mind your business, Maya.

**MAYA**: This IS my business. Jordan's my friend.

She stands next to Jordan. Not aggressive. Just present.

A moment. Derek's group looks at each other. The social calculation shifts. Maya isn't backing down. Jordan isn't alone.

**DEREK**: (loses interest) Whatever. Let's go.

They leave. Jordan exhales.

**JORDAN**: You didn't have to—

**MAYA**: Yeah. I did.

They walk together. Maya glances back at the hallway.

For just a moment, in the afternoon light, she could swear she sees a cafe.

### TAG (30 seconds)

**INT. THE QUESTION CAFE - LATER**

The philosophers are at their usual spots. Diogenes is still arguing with the espresso machine.

**ARISTOTLE**: She did well.

**KANT**: She acted on principle. Eventually.

**GILLIGAN**: She asked the right question.

**PASCAL**: The expected value was positive, I think.

**DIOGENES**: (to espresso machine) YOU'RE STILL A LIAR. (to others) She'll be back. They always are.

A new name appears faintly on the wall: MAYA

Under her question—"What does my friend need from me right now?"—another question appears, in a child's handwriting:

"How do I know if I did the right thing?"

**KANT**: (satisfied) It begins.

**FADE TO BLACK.**

**END OF EPISODE**

## POST-CREDITS: THE QUESTION OF THE WEEK

A simple card appears with a question for viewers to consider:

> **"What would you have done?"**
>
> Maya chose to help Jordan. But what if helping Jordan meant missing something important? What if Derek was bigger? What if no one saw?
>
> Sometimes there's no right answer. That's when the questions matter most.
>
> Talk about it with someone you trust.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

### Episode Goals
1. **Establish the world** (Question Cafe as liminal space)
2. **Introduce all five philosophers** without lecture
3. **Model the show's pattern** (dilemma → perspectives → synthesis → choice)
4. **Leave questions open** (Maya's choice is shown, not explicitly praised)
5. **Create rewatchability** (details in the cafe reward attention)

### Pacing Notes
- Ma (pregnant pause) moments needed: Maya alone at table, writing on wall
- No background music during key philosophical exchanges
- Let the cafe breathe—establish it visually before dialogue

### Character Introductions
- Kant: precise but not cold
- Diogenes: provocative but not cruel
- Aristotle: warm, teacherly
- Gilligan: connective, notices what others miss
- Pascal: appears less, nervous energy, probability-focused

### Visual Moments
- The Question Wall should be visually rich, reward freeze-framing
- Windows showing possibilities should be impressionistic, not literal
- Cafe should feel alive—objects move slightly, respond to emotion

### Educational Standards Alignment
- SEL: Relationship skills, responsible decision-making
- P4C: Stimulus → question generation → communal inquiry → non-resolution
