# Product Overview

**kgents** is a category-theoretic agent framework that treats agents as morphisms in a category. The system emphasizes composition, ethical behavior, and joy-inducing interactions.

## Core Philosophy

> *"The noun is a lie. There is only the rate of change."*

Agents are not static objects but morphisms that compose, observe, and become. The framework is built on seven design principles:

1. **Tasteful** - Each agent serves a clear, justified purpose
2. **Curated** - Intentional selection over exhaustive cataloging  
3. **Ethical** - Agents augment human capability, never replace judgment
4. **Joy-Inducing** - Delight in interaction; personality matters
5. **Composable** - Agents are morphisms in a category; composition is primary
6. **Heterarchical** - Agents exist in flux, not fixed hierarchy
7. **Generative** - Spec is compression; design should generate implementation

## The Grand Vision: Civilizational Engine

kgents aims to build a **Civilizational Engine** - a system that generates and sustains agent societies at arbitrary scales:

- **Agents are real** - entities with memory, reflection, goals, and growth
- **Societies emerge** - arising from agent interaction, not programming
- **Detail is infinite** - holographic depth (more you look, more you find)
- **You can visit** - as observer, participant, or god

**Heritage**: Built on foundations from ChatDev, Simulacra, Altera (Project Sid), Voyager, and Agent Hospital research.

## Key Features

- **Category Theory Foundation**: All transformations are functors with verified laws
- **Polynomial Agents**: State-dependent behavior via `PolyAgent[S, A, B]` with modes
- **AGENTESE Protocol**: Observer-dependent interaction across five contexts (world, self, concept, void, time)
- **17 Atomic Primitives**: Bootstrap agents from which all others compose
- **Operads & Sheaves**: Composition grammar and local-to-global coherence
- **Agent Town**: 7-25 agent simulation with emergent social behavior
- **Metaphysical Fullstack**: Each agent is complete vertical slice from persistence to projection
- **Graceful Degradation**: Always work, even without full infrastructure
- **Self-Modifying Deployment**: Agents can modify their own code in production

## Agent Genera (A-Z Classification)

Agents organized by letter-based genera following category theory:
- **A-gents**: Architecture, functors, archetypes
- **B-gents**: Bio + Banker (resource-constrained systems)  
- **C-gents**: Category Theory (composition primitives)
- **D-gents**: Data (state, memory, persistence)
- **F-gents**: Forge (artifact synthesis)
- **H-gents**: Hegelian/Dialectic (introspection)
- **I-gents**: Interface (visualization)
- **J-gents**: JIT Agent Intelligence (lazy evaluation)
- **K-gent**: Personalization Functor (system's fix point)
- **L-gents**: Library (knowledge curation)
- **M-gents**: Memory (holographic associative memory)
- **N-gents**: Narrator (story-telling, time-travel debugging)
- **O-gents**: Observability (system-wide telemetry)
- **P-gents**: Parser (multi-strategy parsing)
- **Ψ-gents**: Psychopomp (holonic projection, metaphor reification)
- **R-gents**: Refinery (prompt optimization)
- **T-gents**: Testing (algebraic reliability)
- **U-gents**: Utility (tool use, MCP integration)
- **V-gents**: Vector (semantic geometry)
- **W-gents**: Wire (ephemeral process observation)
- **Ω-gents**: Somatic (morphemes, proprioception, infrastructure as body)
