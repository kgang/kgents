# .kgents/ - The Sensorium Root

This directory contains kgents' self-observation infrastructure.

## Structure

```
.kgents/
├── ghost/              # Living filesystem (ephemeral, gitignored)
│   ├── test_flinches.jsonl   # Algedonic signals from test failures
│   ├── ci_signals.jsonl      # Cross-session CI signals
│   └── (future: thought_stream.md, shadow.patch, etc.)
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Philosophy

The system that builds itself must observe itself building.

These files are generated by the meta-bootstrap feedback loops:
- **Test Flinch**: Every failing test emits an algedonic signal
- **CI Signals**: GitHub Actions emit semantic field signals
- **Ghost Files**: Future sensorium will project state here

See `docs/meta-bootstrap-plan.md` for details.
