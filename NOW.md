## Current Focus: Constitutional Decision OS

**THE TRUTH LIVES HERE**: `plans/enlightened-synthesis/`

```
00-master-synthesis.md       ← Master vision (read first)
01-theoretical-amendments.md ← 7 amendments (A done, B-G pending)
02-execution-roadmap.md      ← 8-week pilot-grounded plan
03-risk-mitigations.md       ← 47 vulnerabilities addressed
04-joy-integration.md        ← Joy calibration by domain
05-product-strategy.md       ← Consumer-first path to $1M ARR
```

### The Core Bet

**Galois Loss is real, measurable, and useful.**

Formula: `L(P) = d(P, C(R(P)))`
- R: Restructure via LLM
- C: Reconstitute via LLM
- d: Semantic distance (BERTScore → cosine → fallback)

**What it enables**:
- Axiom detection: `L < 0.05` = fixed point
- Layer assignment: L1-L7 via loss thresholds
- Contradiction detection: super-additivity signals tension

### Amendment Status

| Amendment | Description | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| A | ETHICAL as floor (≥0.6 required) | ✅ DONE |
| B | Bidirectional Entailment Distance | PENDING |
| C | Corpus-relative layer calibration | PENDING |
| D | K-Block monad explicit bind | ✅ EXISTS |
| E | Trust polynomial functor | PENDING |
| F | Fixed-point iteration rigor | PENDING |
| G | Pilot law grammar | PENDING |

### The Five Pilots

| Pilot | Domain | Joy Dimension | Week |
|-------|--------|---------------|------|
| **trail-to-crystal-daily-lab** | Productivity | FLOW | Week 6 (FIRST) |
| wasm-survivors-witnessed-run-lab | Gaming | FLOW | Week 7 |
| disney-portal-planner | Consumer Travel | WARMTH | Week 8 |
| rap-coach-flow-lab | Creative | SURPRISE | Week 7 |
| sprite-procedural-taste-lab | Generative Art | SURPRISE | Week 8 |

**Wedge Pilot**: `trail-to-crystal-daily-lab` — "Turn your day into proof of intention"

## Crown Jewel Status

| Jewel | Status | Tests | Focus |
|-------|--------|-------|-------|
| **Witness** | 98% | 678+ | Mark, Crystal, Grant, Playbook |
| **Zero Seed** | 85% | — | Galois Loss, Layer Assignment |
| **K-Block** | 75% | — | Monad bind, Layer Factories |
| **Constitutional** | 80% | 52 | 7-principle scoring, Amendment A |
| **Brain** | 100% | 200+ | Memory cathedral |

## Quick Wins (< 3 hrs)

```bash
# Wire Galois Loss to layer assignment endpoint
cat brainstorming/handoff-prompt.md | head -120

# Implement Amendment B (Bidirectional Entailment)
# Location: services/zero_seed/galois/distance.py
```

## Major Arc (Multi-Session)

```bash
# Execute 8-week plan
cat plans/enlightened-synthesis/02-execution-roadmap.md

# Build trail-to-crystal pilot
# See: plans/enlightened-synthesis/00-master-synthesis.md
```

---

## Verification

```bash
# Backend quality gate
cd impl/claude && uv run pytest -q && uv run mypy . 2>&1 | tail -5

# Frontend quality gate
cd impl/claude/web && npm run typecheck && npm run lint 2>&1 | tail -5
```

## Aggressive Cleanup (Dec 26)

**Deleted ~550KB of superseded docs**:
- `brainstorming/` reduced to 2 essential files
- `plans/` consolidated to `enlightened-synthesis/` + 3 meta files
- All redundant synthesis docs archived to `_archive/2025-12-26-cleanup/`

**THE ONE TRUTH**: `plans/enlightened-synthesis/`
