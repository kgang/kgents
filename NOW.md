# NOW.md — What's Happening

## Current Work

**Town Frontend** — 60% done. Backend is solid (1559 tests: Sheaf, Events, AGENTESE nodes). Frontend components exist: TownOverview, CitizenBrowser, CoalitionGraph. Need polish and the 3D canvas.

**Coalition/Atelier/Park** — All waiting on Town patterns. Once Town's consent model is proven, the others will follow fast.

**Brain & Gardener** — Production-ready. 100% complete. Could ship now.

**Gestalt** — 70%. Elastic UI works. Needs WebGL depth.

## What I'm Stuck On

**Voice dilution** — The project is losing its edge through LLM processing. Each Claude session smooths a little. Added Anti-Sausage Protocol to CLAUDE.md to address this.

**26 plan files were bureaucracy** — Killed them. This file replaces all of them.

## What I Want Next

Something **daring**. The Coalition visualization should feel like watching emergence happen—agents forming alliances in real-time, visible tension, consent as a first-class citizen.

*"Daring, bold, creative, opinionated but not gaudy"* — this is the bar.

## Session Notes

### 2025-12-18 evening — Crown Jewels Genesis Phase 2
Executed Week 3 of Atelier Rebuild:
- **FishbowlCanvas.tsx**: Live creation stream with breathing border (LIVING_EARTH.amber glow)
- **SpectatorOverlay.tsx**: Eigenvector-based cursor colors, stale cleanup
- **Spectator contracts**: Added to services/atelier/contracts.py
- **useAtelierStream enhanced**: Session subscription, cursor updates, live events
- **35+ tests** for FishbowlCanvas and SpectatorOverlay

**Atelier** now at **80%** (up from 75%). FishbowlCanvas core complete. Next: Integration into AtelierVisualization, then Week 4 BidQueue.

### 2025-12-18 afternoon
- Diagnosed the real problem: voice dilution, not planning mechanics
- Added Anti-Sausage Protocol to CLAUDE.md (Session Start Ritual + Voice Anchors + Anti-Sausage Check)
- Killed Garden Protocol overhead (mood/momentum/trajectory were bureaucracy)
- Created NOW.md to replace 26 plan files
- Kept the useful parts: GardenPolynomial, GARDEN_OPERAD, 200 tests
