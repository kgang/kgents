**Session**: Soft Reset — Re-Centering on Constitutional Decision OS

---

## 🎯 THE FOCUS: Constitutional Decision OS

**After time away, the project re-centers on its core thesis:**

> **Semantic coherence is measurable.** Using Galois Loss `L(P) = d(P, C(R(P)))`, we detect axioms, surface contradictions, and assign epistemic layers.

### The Five L1 Axioms (Non-Negotiable)

```
A1 ENTITY:     Everything representable IS an entity.
A2 MORPHISM:   Composition is preserved (categorical laws hold).
A3 GALOIS:     Loss is measurable: L(P) = d(P, C(R(P))).
A4 WITNESS:    The mark IS the witness. Actions leave traces.
A5 ETHICAL:    You cannot offset unethical behavior. Floor is absolute.
```

**Master Vision**: `plans/enlightened-synthesis/00-master-synthesis.md`

## 📍 Where We Are

```
PHASE 6: CONSTITUTIONAL DECISION OS ← CURRENT

Completed Infrastructure:
├── kgents_governance/  — Gate laws, threshold laws, constitution verification
├── kgents_galois/      — Distance computation, Jaccard, semantic primitives
├── kgents_laws/        — Categorical law verification (identity, associativity)
├── Witness service     — 98% complete, 678+ tests
├── Categorical foundation — 95% faithfulness, laws verified at runtime
└── 24,842 backend tests collected

In Progress:
├── Amendment B: Bidirectional Entailment Distance
├── Amendment C: Corpus-relative layer calibration
└── Pilot: trail-to-crystal-daily-lab (wedge pilot)
```

## 🚀 The Seven Pilots

| Tier | Pilot | Status | Domain |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| **Core** | trail-to-crystal-daily-lab | 🎯 NEXT | Productivity |
| **Core** | zero-seed-personal-governance-lab | Spec | Personal Constitution |
| **Domain** | wasm-survivors-game | Active | Gaming |
| **Domain** | disney-portal-planner | Spec | Consumer Travel |
| **Domain** | rap-coach-flow-lab | Spec | Creative/Coaching |
| **Domain** | sprite-procedural-taste-lab | Spec | Generative Art |
| **Meta** | categorical-foundation-open-lab | Spec | Open-Source |

**Wedge Strategy**: Ship `trail-to-crystal-daily-lab` first → validates Mark → Trace → Crystal pipeline for all pilots.

| **Zero Seed** | 85% | Galois Loss, Layer Assignment |
| **Constitutional** | 80% | 7-principle scoring, Amendment A done |
| **K-Block** | 75% | Monad bind, Layer Factories |
| **Brain** | 100% | Memory cathedral complete |

## ⚡ Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Ship Wedge Pilot (Recommended)
Build `trail-to-crystal-daily-lab`:
- Simple scope: single user, daily cadence
- Validates core pipeline for ALL other pilots
- Fastest path to value: "$15/month productivity app"

### Option B: Complete Amendments
1. **Amendment B**: Bidirectional entailment in `services/zero_seed/galois/distance.py`
2. **Amendment C**: Corpus-relative layer calibration

### Option C: Continue WASM Survivors
The game pilot has significant momentum—38K lines of active development.
Consider completing one system fully (e.g., audio, formations) before context switching.
